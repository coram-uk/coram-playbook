    about: >
      With digital and technological capabilities growing and AI-tools
      increasingly prevalent, many organisations are deploying new and emerging
      technology to support the delivery of a range of services to children,
      young people and families. 


      Such initiatives often involve improving the use of data and ensuring data sources across services are more seamlessly integrated to benefit those using services.
    why: >
      Technology offers a range of benefits. Digital platforms provide a unique
      opportunity to engage with children and young people in an accessible way
      and can support the workforce to do their jobs more efficiently so they
      can focus their time on working with children and families.


      When services are able to better understand and process their data, they can offer targeted and more effective support to children, young people and families.
