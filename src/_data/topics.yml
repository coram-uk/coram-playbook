    about: >
      Early Intervention and Early Help models are designed to identify
      children, young people and families who may be at risk of poor outcomes
      early and offer proactive and effective support to prevent needs from
      escalating. These are sometimes referred to as preventative approaches and
      improve the life chances of children, young people and families.
    why: >
      Children who receive proactive support are more likely to have their needs
      met and to benefit from improved wellbeing and more stable homes lives.

    about: >-
      Children in care do better when they’re placed with family members or
      other adults they know and trust. But identifying and connecting with
      extended family members can be a challenge for foster care programs.


      Child welfare systems who have adopted the practices listed on this page are able to place children with relatives more than 80% of the time.


      **Track adoption of these practices on the [progress dashboard](/compare/Family%20Finding)**.
    why: >-
      Children can’t have too many adults who care about them. A strong support
      system of adults supports young people’s resiliency and long term health
      and well-being. 


      But most youth enter foster care with more connections than they leave with.
    what: >-
      **Ask young people.** Children often have more supportive people in their
      lives than you — or they — realize. And the ways you ask children about
      their networks can get different results. For example, try questions like,
      “If you were stuck and needed a ride, who would you call?” or "Who came to
      your birthday party?" and use tools like heart maps to draw out more
      connections. 


      **Use social media.** While no technology can automate kin-finding, looking up known kin on social media can uncover even more potential supportive adults and placements, and makes it easier to reach them. 


      **Try the “snowball method.”** The “snowball method” is when you ask one contact for more contacts. Each time you connect with someone in a child’s life, ask them for suggestions of other people to contact. 


      **Document as you go.** Support networks can get complicated. Find a template that works for you — like a genogram or heart map — and keep it up to date as you identify more connections. 


      **Maintain an expansive definition of kin.** Children don't care if they're a certain degree of legally related to the adults they love. Kin includes everyone who matters to a child, including teachers, godparents, and neighbors. 


      **Make plans to keep kids connected to their kin.** Kin are useful for far more than "just" placements. Every child in care should have a plan for staying connected with all their kin. Over time, this support network can ensure that child never has to live with a stranger in foster care.


      **Never stop looking.** Finding kin should be an ongoing activity. Missing connections may surface or have changes in circumstances, and new kinship relationships can develop over time, too.


      **Shift placement desk incentives** Require a supervisor's signature for any non-kin placements, even in the middle of the night, to encourage the placement desk to prioritize finding kin placements.

    about: There are a variety of ways to compensate resource families beyond the
      standard room and board rate (which itself can vary based on different
      factors), including special salaried foster parent programs and ad hoc
      additional employment opportunities.
    why: Every caregiver of a dependent child should have financial support to
      provide a stable and supportive placement. In many systems, kinshp
      caregivers lack access to these resources. And in the case of some youth
      with high levels of need, growing professional foster parent programs are
      proving better outcomes and helping keep these youth out of institutions.
      And providing smaller but meaningful ways for your families to earn extra
      money for related work, like co-leading trainings, can increase
      satisfaction and retention.
    what: >-
      

      * **Look for additional ways to compensate foster parents.** This might take the form of paying them to appear on panels, provide mentoring to new families, or incentive payment for providing referrals or placement stability. 

      * **Pay for respite.** Every foster parent needs a break sometimes. 

      * **Pay your kinship caregivers** If your system has the practice of unlicensed (unpaid) kin, look for ways to either secure state funding to fill in the gap, or streamline your licensing process and take greater advantage of relative non-safety exemptions to get all your relatives licensed and eligile for IV-E reimbursement. (Reach out to us for pro bono advice!) 

      * **Establish a professional foster parent program.** A professional foster parent doesn't have to (indeed, shouldn't) have outside employment or income; they receive a salary in exchange for committing to fully meeting the needs of the child in their home. These programs can help avoid institutional placements and, when designed well, are generating impressive outcomes for even children with very high levels of need.

    about: Foster parent licensing can be a lengthy, and at times inefficient,
      process. Delays in licensing can mean losing homes in a time when
      placement options are already severely limited.
    why: While it is important to be thorough, delays in the process can overburden
      licensing workers and inspectors or even risk losing families.
    what: >-
      

      * **Increase support for licensing workers.** Providing clerical support for licensing workers helps staff maintain a higher case load, while increasing family satisfaction. If you can give families a dedicated licensor through the whole process, staff will be able to reduce the likelihood of errors while developing a more holistic picture of the family. 

      * **Make safety inspections easier for families.** Some families do not pass the inspection on the first try simply because they were missing one or more items that they didn’t know they needed. When an inspector has to return, it makes the process longer by weeks or months. By providing families with a checklist of safety items ahead of time, as well as providing families with items they need but cannot acquire, you can streamline the safety inspection process and avoid delays.

      * **Continue licensing and training while social distancing.** Some agencies paused their licensing or training during the pandemic. However, federal regulations do not require that these processes take place in person. By providing foster parent training online and conducting key parts of the licensing process remotely (like doing the initial safety walkthrough over video), you can avoid having to halt your licensing and training work during the pandemic.
