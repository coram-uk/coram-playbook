    about: >
      The **Bright Beginnings** project works with vulnerable young parents
      under 25 who are pregnant or have a child under 2, offering support
      focused on improving both parental and infant health. The project derived
      from the Family Nurse Partnership (FNP) in Southampton, with the idea of
      providing similar support to parents who would not typically meet the FNP
      criteria. Designed to give parents a trusted, knowledgeable adult, No
      Limits assign one to one support to parents, either through a paid youth
      worker or a volunteer, a ‘befriender’.


      Acting as a ‘community grandparent’, befrienders give parenting guidance and advice, help to navigate community services and resources as well as being a consistent presence in a parent’s life. This enables parents to look after both their own physical and emotional health and that of their child. Befrienders may guide parents through various processes and paperwork they need to go through as new parents, for example immunisations for their child. With the addition of paid youth workers to the model as a result of a large number of referrals, No Limits can now provide more regular and proactive support to parents, especially around safeguarding.


      In addition, **Bright Beginnings** now offers a training course, Gro Brain, for parents who are pregnant or have a child under 1, aiming to help develop emotionally healthy infants. Most referrals come from within No Limits, but parents can also be referred by children’s services or health visitors. The intention is to extend the project to young parents who are isolated and do not have family support to assist with the development of parenting skills.

    how: >-
      * Create a secure, generic email address for receiving requests instead of
      using an individual’s account. This provides a consistent process that
      won’t be disrupted by staff transition or vacation time.

      * Make your request form computer-friendly. Turn your current form into a fillable PDF, Web form, or a standard Microsoft Word document. Paper forms have to be completed and scanned, creating additional barriers to submitting them — and then for reading them.

      * Provide an online portal for accepting background check requests as part of any future system modernization efforts.

    about: >
      Developed and funded by the Tasmanian government, **Bringing Baby Home**
      is an early intervention pilot programme providing intensive support to
      parents of infants classified as ‘at-risk’ to help prevent entry into the
      care system. As part of the programme, not-for-profit organisations like
      Key Assets Australia in Tasmania deliver a range of bespoke services with
      the aim of increasing parents’ capacity to parent safely. As part of an
      intensive, time-limited programme, parents are afforded the opportunity to
      develop their childcare skills while actively parenting full time within a
      supervised and supportive environment.


      In Tasmania, Key Assets Australia work with parents in their homes across a 12-week period. During the first four weeks, monitoring, support and coaching is provided 24/7 in the home by a small team of Key Assets practitioners and key members of the family’s personal support network. The model includes a range of elements; from comprehensive assessment to familial network development, counselling, targeted parenting education, emotional and practical support, advocacy and a respite care service. In some cases where the baby cannot be cared for in the home, parents and infant may be accommodated by a residential service.  Key Assets Australia’s **Bringing Baby Home Service** will partner with the residential service to provide Parenting Education and support transition and in-home support where suitable.


      Although a formal evaluation of the pilot is yet to take place, there are indications that the programme helps to reduce risk through stabilising mental health, the implementation of harm minimisation practices, new knowledge and skills, safety plans and better support networks. There is also evidence that the programme allows babies to remain in their homes, with the support of wider networks.  An external pilot evaluation is expected and Key Assets are exploring potential opportunities to work with parents prior to birth. 
    how: >-
      * Ask prospective foster families if they’ve lived out-of-state during
      your initial meeting with them — or even before, when you can.

      * Find the relevant Adam Walsh/out-of-state background check forms, either in your state or county’s Adam Walsh database or on the other state’s website.

      * Take a laptop to orientation for people interested in being foster parents and help them fill out online background check forms.

      * Take paper background check forms and make sure people understand how to fill them out.

      * If any of the background check forms require notarization, arrange for a volunteer notary to attend orientation and sign off on multiple forms at once.
    outcome: We’re still collecting concrete data. But we believe that this will
      shorten the time it takes to approve foster families who’ve lived out of
      state.

      **Dream, Believe, Succeed** is an in-school and extracurricular programme
      that seeks to divert young people away from serious violence through
      offering a curriculum of inspiring, creative experiences. The project,
      which won the CYPN Youth Work Award in 2022, is a partnership between a
      number of local organisations in Edmonton. This early intervention
      programme is specifically designed to align with the interests and
      ambitions of the young people it supports and provides a safe space for
      them to express their concerns or anxieties related to gangs and youth
      violence. Youth mentors work with young people through both one-to-one and
      group sessions. The sessions involve creative arts elements, for example,
      drama, role play or spoken word, and workshops are also delivered by
      industry experts, including artists, musicians and filmmakers. The
      programme aims to offer guidance to young people on how they may approach
      certain scenarios and make positive choices. Other aspects include working
      with the British DJ and MC Academy to develop a radio station presented by
      children for children and there is an additional family intervention
      aspect. To further elevate the educational experiences of at-risk youth,
      **Dream, Believe, Succeed** also facilitates 'Closing the Gap' math
      workshops, with the goal of levelling up their academic abilities and
      preparing them for the world ahead. At the end of the programme, there is
      a production at a local theatre produced by the children involved.


      In Edmonton, the programme is delivered across 18 schools, including both primary and secondary schools, a Pupil Referral Unit (PRU) and a special needs college.

    title: Early-Intervention-and-Prevention-Model
    about: >
      Birmingham City Council, supported by EY as a strategic partner, have
      pioneered an **Early Intervention & Prevention (EI&P)** approach in light
      of a council-wide corporate priority to shift focus


      and investment from crisis to prevention. The model seeks to enable staff to support citizens more upstream, to help them build resilience and independence, with a focus on those at risk of domestic abuse, homelessness and poverty. It follows the theory that through intervening early, people are less likely to escalate to a crisis stage, leading to better outcomes for the person or family and the council are able to avoid more costly statutory intervention. In Birmingham, this whole council shift was preceded by previous work in adult’s services to move towards greater investment in prevention within communities and the development of a strengths-based, locality-based model of social work.


      Birmingham’s **EI&P model**, which was co-produced with a range of local stakeholders, moves away from considering the issues individuals or families face in isolation, for example as simply children’s services related or simply housing-related, and instead looks at the whole picture of what an individual or family is facing over their life course. It focuses on identifying both the risk factors and the protective factors that can stop a family or individual escalating to requiring a higher level of statutory intervention, with prevention focused around providing activities, signposting and support that can prevent the issue from arising in the first place.


      Birmingham’s citizen-centric model focuses on enabling independence and supporting citizens to be economically and socially active across their lives. Through developing a coherent prevention pathway, the model leverages and encourages collaboration between a range of council, community and voluntary sector, and wider public sector partner services to allow people to be directed to the right place in the system at the right time for them. It also utilises the capacity in the community to offer support in more accessible and familiar settings.


      Crucial to the model is a strong focus on data and insight and pooling data from multiple council sources to develop an integrated view of the citizen, so that resources can be directed to ensure the most appropriate support or signposting can be delivered. Birmingham is at the start of its data journey but there is an ambition to embed a predictive element of analytics to identify families requiring support in an automated way.


      To date a key focus of the model in the context of the cost of living has been to look at supporting citizens who may be financially vulnerable to develop financial resilience and enable them to remain in secure housing, via a ‘Homes and Money Advice’ offer. This includes a more human-centric approach to supporting individuals in arrears, for example sending a Whatsapp message and offering a call to explore support options, rather than the traditional approach of sending a letter.


      As part of this work, in 2023 the Council undertook a 6-week pilot, supported by the West Midlands Combined Authority, using a data-driven ‘nudge’ tool to support 39 individuals and families who were at risk of requiring statutory intervention. The pilot focused on supporting access to the council’s wider Homes & Money Hub offer, using customer contact data to identify where customers had applied for some elements of cost of living support but not others despite being eligible. Through proactive engagement, Birmingham’s advisors were able to help the cohort claim an additional £94,000 in benefits and welfare. Modelling also suggested that 17 out of the 39 individuals were registered as disabled but not known to adult social care and through supporting this cohort to maintain financial resilience and remain outside of adult social care, there was an associated cost avoidance of £1.32m per annum.


      With initial promising results, the model is showing the value to citizens and council services of a supportive and dedicated approach to working with citizens early on and in a proactive manner.

    heading: Family Group Conferences at Pre-Proceedings Stage
    about: >
      **Family Group Conferences (FGCs)** involve the family leading a meeting
      of a child’s family, friends and network to come up with a plan to keep a
      child safe. A long-established and widespread practice deriving from New
      Zealand, it acknowledges the value of the family being central to the
      decision-making process for a child. Children may play a part in their own
      family group conference and the process is coordinated and supported by an
      independent coordinator.


      A recent large-scale evaluation led by Coram, funded by Foundations – What Works Centre for Children & Families and supported by the charity Daybreak – the first of its kind- has demonstrated the impact of **FGCs** at the pre-proceedings stage. Supported by the charity Daybreak, the evaluation involved a randomised controlled trial, process evaluation and cost analysis, and considered the key factors in successfully delivering the approach and the impact on outcomes for children and families. A total of 2,500 children and almost 1,500 families took part across 21 local authorities, with half of the families receiving this intervention and the other half continuing to receive the standard local authority service.


      The [evaluation ](https://foundations.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Randomised-controlled-trial-family-group-conferencing.pdf)found that in the twelve months after the pre-proceedings letter was issued, children whose families were referred for an **FGC** were less likely to enter care, with just over a third (36.2%) going into care after being referred to an **FGC**, compared to almost half (44.8%) of those who were not referred for an **FGC**. They were also less likely to have care proceedings issued and 6 months later, they had been in care for less time than those who were not referred for an **FGC**.


      There were no statistically significant differences in factors such as how included parents felt in their child’s care planning or whether children’s living arrangements had changed, however. The evaluation also indicated that cost savings of using **FGC**, with £960 being saved per child referred in the first year. The analysis found that if the approach was implemented across England, over 2,000 fewer children would enter care every year, with estimated savings of over £150 million in two years. The evaluation recommended the use of this approach more widely across the country, especially where it is delivered to a high-quality and complemented by other longer-term intervention. The evaluation also recommended further research to understand the impact of **FGCs** earlier than pre-proceedings, and Coram is working with Foundations to take forward work on **FGCs**.

      The **Focused Deterrence** programme is being trialled across five English
      cities following a £7 million investment by the Home Office and Youth
      Endowment Fund. The project is aimed at deterring young people from
      violence. The programme originated in Boston in the USA where it was
      developed in response to growing gun violence, with suggestions that it
      can lead to a 33% decrease in crime. It has been adopted successfully
      across the UK.


      The approach involves police, local councils, community organisations, health services, schools, colleges and probation services working together to identify those aged 14 and over involved in or at risk of becoming involved in serious violence. Tailored support is then delivered, including mentoring, facilitation of education, employment and training opportunities, mental health and housing support.


      The programme aims to reduce violence by identifying and addressing the underlying causes of violence and working together with communities to prevent it. It is being led by Violence Reduction Units or Networks in Coventry and Wolverhampton, Nottingham, Leicester and Manchester.


      The programme began in May 2023 and will run until August 2025, with the University of Hull conducting an evaluation of the programme across the five cities.

      **For Baby’s Sake** is a programme working therapeutically with families
      to break the cycle of domestic abuse and give babies the best start in
      life. Both parents join **For Baby’s Sake** during pregnancy, whether
      together as a couple or not, and are supported individually (each by their
      own Practitioner) up until the baby’s second birthday. The programme’s
      trauma-informed and attachment focused approach provides parents with what
      they want and need to make changes for themselves and their baby. They are
      empowered not to be defined by their past, and to become the parent and
      person they want to be. The therapeutic content and trusting relationship
      each parent builds with their practitioner, underpinned by robust
      multi-agency safeguarding, are key change mechanisms for achieving
      positive outcomes for all family members. Parents testify that the ‘inner
      child’ therapeutic core supports them ‘make peace with the past’ while the
      attachment-focused parenting content, including Video Interaction
      Guidance, supports parents to provide attuned, sensitive parenting and
      support their baby’s social, emotional and cognitive development, building
      foundations for learning, school readiness and life-long resilience.


      Babies develop well, emotionally, socially and cognitively, in line with low risk groups. Other outcomes include reduced domestic abuse, improvements in parents’ emotional regulation and wellbeing, improved engagement with children’s services and other agencies and reduced safeguarding needs. A major evaluation by King’s College London, published in 2020, found **For Baby’s Sake** to be the first programme to address key limitations in whole-family responses to domestic abuse. **For Baby’s Sake** is influencing national understanding of what works. It won the 2021 Centre for Justice Innovation award for Family Justice. The programme won the CYPNow Safeguarding award for the partnership in Blackpool. Other areas where the programme operates include Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea. For Baby’s Sake featured in two National Safeguarding Practice Panel reports (notably for engaging fathers) and in Foundations (What Works for Children and Families) reports as one of few particularly promising programmes for children and families affected by DA.

    about: >
      Building on its established history in the social housing space, Grosvenor
      has established **Grosvenor Hart Homes** **(GHH)**. **GHH** is a new
      social enterprise seeking to improve the life chances of vulnerable
      children, young people and families by providing high-quality, affordable
      homes alongside bespoke,


      wrap-around support services, focusing on employment and wellbeing support. The initiative is premised on the understanding that a safe and secure home is fundamental to stability and that from this foundation, holistic support can boost individual and familial wellbeing, economic security and longer term prospects. A key feature of the model is the role of a ‘Family Assistant’, helping to coordinate access to the GHH service model and services offered by external partners, building strong, trusted relationship with tenants.


      **GHH** is developing a 3-year proof of concept in the Chester area, with a small number of newly renovated homes. It is specifically aimed at supporting cohorts including care leavers, young people at risk of NEET and ‘vulnerable’ families, including those affected by mental health, trauma and domestic violence. In addition, a number of properties are available as affordable housing to those on the council’s housing register and as market rent properties, contributing to the development of a balanced community.


      **GHH** has worked closely with the local authority to ensure the model aligns with and complements existing council priorities and processes. This has included the local authority helping to shape the suite of services designed locally and the **GHH** housing allocation process, supporting the identification of and assessment of suitable tenants via an innovative multi-agency matching panel. **GHH** has appointed specialist service design agencies, Dartington Service Design Lab and Engine Service Design, to design the range of evidence-based services offered, with continued input from both potential service users and national and local experts from the public, private and third sector. With the Family Assistant acting as a navigator, other services being developed include mental health and wellbeing support and life skills training, as well as a jobs brokerage and employment support service, which includes a business incubator. There is also an on-site flexible workspace, the Grosvenor Hart Hub, which is accessible both to tenants and the wider community. All of these services have been designed to integrate with and adapt to the local context.


      The model will undergo continued iteration and improvement over the proof-of-concept period, informed by service users, best practice and capitalising on emerging technology, to ensure it is delivering on its ambition to provide high-quality services that enhance the life chances of children, young people and families. Over the next 10 years, **GHH** is looking to provide more than 750 homes in the north-west as well as in central London, aiming to create a model which can be scaled for wider benefit.

      You can use a genogram tool like the ones we list below or simply a blank
      piece of paper or dry-erase board. Here are some tips:


      * Start making a family tree to show a child’s connections. 

      * Include all important connections, even if they aren’t legal or blood relatives.

      * Use the tree to generate new leads and to keep track of your contacts and progress.

      * [The Extreme Family Finding Project](https://www.fosteradopt.org/family-permanency/extreme-family-finding/) — which has a 95% success rate — recommends a genogram have at least 150-200 people on it.


      There are some additional tools that staff may consider using. These tools are helpful on their own, but work best when coupled with a genogram: 


      * [Accurint](https://www.accurint.com/): Records search from LexisNexis. 

      * [TLOxp](https://www.tlo.com/) (The Last One): Records search from TransUnion, one of the three credit bureaus. 

      * [Find a Grave](https://www.findagrave.com/): This tool can be helpful for completing genograms.
    costs:
      - Genogram software (optional, but helpful)
    benefits:
      - Find more kin who can take placement and/or serve as lifelong support
        for vulnerable youth
      - Find some kin your agency would not otherwise find
      - Makes it easy for multiple workers to collaborate on a child’s
        supportive network, and to follow up with those connections over time

    title: Lullaby-Project
    about: >
      Aiming to support maternal mental health, early childhood development and
      family wellbeing, **Lullaby Project** involves new mothers working with
      professional musicians to write a personal lullaby for their baby. The
      **Lullaby** model was originally introduced in New York’s Carnegie Hall to
      support mothers in healthcare settings, homeless shelters, high schools
      and in prisons. Musicians are trained by a Teaching Artist from Carnegie
      Hall. Linked to a wider social prescribing programme, during the project,
      the parent is supported to write a letter to their baby, which forms the
      basis for a song which is co-developed with a musician and which harnesses
      the creativity of the parent. The songs is then recorded and given to the
      parent for their baby. Songs have been written in a number of languages,
      with a diverse range of parents taking part. The key objectives are to
      develop parental self-confidence and wellbeing, enhance child development,
      bring together communities and address health inequalities. The project
      now works acros


      Liverpool and South West Yorkshire, as well as at sites in Wales. Live Music Now is working with the Institute of Cultural Capital in Liverpool to develop an evaluation framework. The findings from the New York project indicate an impact in terms of reaching families in need, building connections between caregivers and babies, enhancing the child’s language, social and communication skills.

      * Redesign your planning meeting invitation - The invitation should serve
      as a prompt and remind staff to invite as many supportive adults as they
      can, ideally three times as many supportive adults as paid staff members. 

      * Redesign your meeting sign in sheet - Provide enough room for supportive adults to sign in for in-person meetings. For example, you might have four times as many lines in the “supportive adult” area than in the “staff” area. 

      * Ask youth about supportive adults in their lives - Staff should make sure that supportive adults are aware of and invited to planning meetings. You might even ask youth to suggest a supportive adult themselves. 

      * Keep track of meeting attendance - With a simple spreadsheet, you can keep track of the breakdown of roles at planning meetings. Use this information to keep track of progress towards the goal of having three times as many supportive adults as paid staff in attendance. * Keep asking about supportive adults as new goals arise - A youth may have one or more supportive adults who generally attend meetings, but may have an additional support for a specific goal, such as practicing for a driving test, getting mentoring in math, or shopping for a prom dress.

    outcome: Olmsted County, MN demonstrated significantly better outcomes for older
      foster youth when a ratio of 3:1 supportive adults to paid staff attended
      their planning meetings (roughly 12 family members to 3 staff members).

    about: >
      Blackpool Better Start have implemented a **Speech, Language and
      Communication (SLC) Triage Panel** to improve early identification of and
      support for children with speech, language and communication needs. It was
      formed in 2020 in order to identify local children who were not accessing
      language assessments and interventions. This panel comprises of a
      multi-agency team, including an NHS SLC therapist, an SLC Therapist from
      the commissioned service ‘Communicate’, the local authority Early Years
      Team Manager, a literacy advisory teacher, a Community Connector from
      Blackpool Better Start and is Chaired by The Early Years Senior Manager.
      Meeting every two weeks, the panel considers new referrals and discusses
      the next steps for children as they approach the end of their
      interventions. Referrals come from both health and pre-schools, usually
      after a child’s WellComm Assessment. Following referral, a Community
      Connector is assigned to each family and as part of an informal phone
      conversation, they help them to understand what the panel will involve, as
      well as finding out more about the child, family and any challenges
      accessing services. This can include factors such as digital poverty or
      complex needs of children and other family members. This information is
      then fed back to the panel, allowing them to understand the type of
      interventions that would be helpful and accessible to the family
      considering their individual circumstances, to maximise the chance of
      successful engagement. After the panel, families receive a letter
      proposing the next steps and the Community Connector briefs the family on
      what will happen next. Across the intervention period, the Community
      Connector will stay in touch with the family. Following the intervention,
      the panel discuss the child’s case again and propose next steps based on
      the child’s individual circumstances.


      Between April 2022 and March 2023, this multi-agency approach has received 631 referrals with 461 families (73%) receiving Community Connector Support. Every child referred into the panel receives a Speech, Language and Communication support Pack out together by the Community Connectors which contains bespoke information and advice and a book donated by either The National Literacy Trust, The Book Trust or The Centre for Early Child Development.

    about: >
      The **Raising Rochdale SEND Team** is a multi-agency alliance that aims to
      improve support and outcomes for children and young people with Special
      Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) in Rochdale, United Kingdom. The
      project was initiated in January 2021, with the support of the Council for
      Disabled Children (CDC), to create an integrated service for children and
      young people with SEND. This was a departure from the previous system,
      which worked in siloes.


      Prioritising the outcomes of children and young people and in collaboration with families, the alliance has scoped out early intervention offers to identify gaps and patterns and put in place a robust information sharing system, as well as establishing clear outcomes and measures. As a result, the number of children receiving early intervention and support has grown, and more professionals are accessing training. The waiting times for an autism diagnosis and support have also reduced, and three new peer-led projects are in development.


      The **Raising Rochdale SEND** Team won the Public Sector Children’s Team Award at the Children and Young People Now Awards 2022, recognising the work to implement an Outcomes-Based Accountability (OBA) approach to commissioning and enhance support and outcomes for 5,913 children and young people who require SEND support.

      The UK government has allocated £2.8 million to fund eight new projects
      across England aimed at **reducing parental conflict** and supporting
      families in need. The projects will target families at risk of conflict
      and provide face-to-face and digital support to promote healthier
      relationships between parents, helping families lead more fulfilling
      lives. The projects will also help parents in early stages of conflict to
      deal with their difficulties, improve their lives and ensure a stable and
      healthy environment for the children. The projects will support a diverse
      range of parents across England to manage their relationship difficulties,
      including those with children who have special educational needs, those in
      rural areas, young parents, LGBTQ+ parents, black, Asian, minority ethnic
      families, and parents at risk of unemployment.


      Coram was successful in securing funding for their project – using relational therapy solutions with families facing adversity. Coram’s Creative Parenting Services will combine practice to offer couples under 30 at risk of family conflict a new schools programme. Coram’s three tier offer provides Child and Family Interventions, evaluation and analysis with insight into what works with disadvantaged families to pre-empt and reduce conflict, and training and dissemination of materials and tools for use as self-help or facilitated interventions. This initiative will focus on several disadvantaged families with stressors in the Camden and Lambeth area.

    title: Talking-Transitions
    about: >
      **Talking Transitions** focuses on improving speech and language skills,
      aiming to ease the transition to primary school for children. The
      programme is in its fifth year, having expanded across the Southend
      region. With the intention of building relationships between providers,
      the scheme involves the creation of a number of ‘satellites’ combining
      local schools and early years settings (pre-school, day nurseries and
      childminders), each with expertise in early communication and language.
      The providers in each satellite collaborate closely to develop and deliver
      a range of fun experiences and activities for children, designed to
      support their emotional wellbeing, speech, language and communication.


      Key parts of the model include the ‘Learning Together’ component, involving a 10-week accredited Elklan speech and language course for feeder settings and schools focused on 3-5 year olds facilitated jointly by health and education teams. The ‘Working Together’ element provides a chance for those in each satellite to have a detailed discussion about children transitioning from early years to schools, both in terms of their personalities and overall strengths and difficulties, informed by findings from the child’s WellComm assessment. Following this session, strategies are devised for both parents and schools to follow, underpinned by a shared language. Lastly, as part of ‘Being together’ activities where primary schools and early years settings come together to create a programme of summer events at the child’s new school, which focus on communication and language. At these events, children come together with their parents, carers and families and simple strategies and themed activities to support language and communication are modelled. In addition, as part of the transition, teachers visit early years settings and the model integrates with the Family Centres over the summer holidays, offering Stay and Play sessions to keep the families engaged in the programme. The school SENDCO may also attend the Family Centre to get to know the child prior to them starting school.


      **Talking Transitions** won the CYPN Early Years award in 2022, with judges commending the manner in which it enhanced relationships between schools and early years providers, equipped professionals through specialist training and boosted knowledge among parents. Feedback from participants has also been positive, with headteachers remarking on the value of transition events and the increase in attendance from parents as a result of the activity-based approach to building speech and language skills. It has reached over 1,000 families to date and **Talking Transitions** hopes to broaden its reach so more children are able to receive speech and language support and benefit from a smoother, more coordinated transition to school.

      The **Therapeutic Intervention for Peace (TIP)** Programme provides

      delivered by the charity Power The Fight, takes a preventative, whole
      systems approach, offering a range of consultancy, training, workshops,
      supervision and reflective practice. The **TIP** team includes
      psychologists, youth practitioners and an art therapist, who all bring
      their own creative approaches and expertise to the programme and ensure
      that young people from diverse backgrounds feel able to access the
      support. One key focus of the project is on tackling school exclusion, and
      support and guidance is also offered to teachers, staff, parents and
      carers as part of the programme, including, for example, cultural
      sensitivity training for teachers and staff. It seeks to embed a
      longer-term therapeutic approach across the system. An evaluation of the
      delivery of the approach in two schools and one alternative provision
      setting in South London over a 12 month period highlighted positive
      findings of the approach. **TIP** was also innovative in its approach to
      data collection, adapting assessments to individual children and their
      needs, with one approach being for a child to kick a football in a
      direction to indicate their answer to a question! Findings include
      improvements in wellbeing scores, better understanding of mental health,
      coping mechanisms and self-regulation and better engagement in school or
      alternative provision and prevention of exclusion. Improvements were also
      noted in staff wellbeing, as well as evidence increased cultural
      sensitivity and inclusivity and better partnerships.


      From September 2023, **TIP** will be delivered in three secondary schools that are all part of the same school trust which will enable the programme to be tested at a trust wide level, with more opportunity to develop the system change aspects of the work. Power The Fight continue to share their learning with the youth, education and therapeutic sectors through regular research reports that are available on the website and it is hoped that, in the future, this learning element will become more embedded through partnerships with other organisations who might want to take a similar approach to addressing youth violence and increasing access to culturally sensitive, therapeutic support.

    heading: Transitions and Preparation for Adulthood Service – Birmingham City Council
    about: >
      Birmingham City Council’s created the **Transitions and Preparation for
      Adulthood Service** in January 2023. It combines the statutory Transitions
      Team, which supports young people with a learning disability or physical
      disability with assessment and care, and the new non-statutory Preparation
      for Adulthood (PFA) service. The combined service was developed following
      a successful two-year proof of concept trialling the PFA service, which
      demonstrated positive outcomes for the young people it supported. Young
      people eligible for support under PFA included those aged 14-25 with
      additional needs transitioning to adulthood, including care leavers, those
      at risk of homelessness or interaction with the criminal justice system,
      and parental or personal mental health issues.


      Reflecting the whole-council approach which centres prevention rather than crisis, the new **Transitions and Preparation for Adulthood Service** merges these two services with a new tiered offer to young people aged 14-25. This continues to offer support to those with complex needs but also has an offer for young people who do not meet statutory thresholds but have factors impacting their ability to live independently both the short-term and longer-term. This might include those struggling with isolation, poor physical or mental health, difficulty accessing employment, those at risk of homeless or exploitation. The service works collaboratively with young people for a maximum of six months via an integrated multi-agency approach, involving one-to-one coaching, goal setting, group work and signposting and connection to other services. It centres on four key areas: employability and financial independence, independent living, health and wellbeing and friendship, relationships and community inclusion.


      This unique approach has been widely commended, with the PFA service recognised as an example of good practice in a recent Department of Health and Social Care report on the importance of transitional safeguarding within adult social work. Outcomes of the PFA service included young people supported finding employment, housing, friendship and being able to better access health service and it is hoped these outcomes will be replicated among the wider group accessing this service.


      The new combined service follows an invest to save model, and it expected to save the council £2.3m by March 2025. It is expected that this cohort will need less system support later down the line. By intervening early, the **Transitions and Preparation for Adulthood Service** aims to improve life outcomes for those it supports, increasing resilience, independence and economic and social wellbeing and improve quality of life.

      **VSEND** is a tool designed to support professionals working with
      children and young people in Hertfordshire. Access to the **VSEND** tool
      follows a comprehensive training session. 


      The tool aims to standardise the approach to identifying needs earlier and improving outcomes for children and young people. It is part of the SEND Transformation in Hertfordshire. The tool and training are available to professionals including education, health, and social care teams, and any other professionals who may come into contact with **VSEND** through the course of their usual work. The **VSEND** tool and approach have a number of key benefits, establishing a common language when describing levels of need, analysing provision, and enabling planning of how to meet needs. It aids the work of professionals and promotes collaboration between staff and parents. It also supports the child by enabling robust tracking of progress made and supporting annual review and transition planning. The tool allows settings and professionals to build a peer support network and share best practice and support strategies. It supports settings to identify gaps and areas for further development (resource / budget allocation, training, and recruitment). 


      The **VSEND** training programme comprises of an initial training session, which is bespoke to the professionals’ sector (education, health, social care etc). Education settings then have a programme of refresher sessions and focused workshops provided through their DSPL Manager and SEND Lead. These all provide professionals with a better understanding of what the **VSEND** tool and approach is, how and when they might come across **VSEND** in their role, and how **VSEND** can support their role. The programme also offers a range of resources such as **VSEND** prompts and assessment statements, guidance slides for navigating the tool, and a printable sheet for parents.

      * Dedicating a single case worker to licensing will only add value if
      there are no more than 2-3 families per case worker. Look across your
      existing team and identify opportunities to expand the scope of some or
      all workers’ roles in exchange for smaller case loads. 

      * Consider restructuring teams that have highly-specialized roles within the licensing process to more generalized roles. This requires careful planning and cross-training. 

      * Pilot this effort with one or two workers who are interested in being dedicated licensors. Survey families they work with and families other team members work with to evaluate whether there is a meaningful difference in satisfaction, withdrawal rates, or licensing completion times. 

      * Providing adequate clerical support is still valuable in a team with dedicated licensors.

    about: >
      Awarded the prize for Early Intervention at the CYPN awards in 2022,
      **Beyond the Banter** was a peer-led project, seeking to empower Black men
      and boys to have important conversations with peers across communities
      about mental health. Recognising the value of peer support to boost
      engagement, the programme trained Peer Educators and equipped them with
      the skills to open up conversations about emotional and mental wellbeing
      and encourage boys to get help if they need it. Although they received
      Mental Health First Aid training, Peer Educators are not experts in mental
      health but were guided and supported to safely and meaningfully share
      their experiences and stories to aid better understanding of wellbeing and
      the help available, and build resilience among a cohort who are
      statistically more likely to have had experiences impacting their
      wellbeing due to many factors, especially those related to racism and
      racial trauma. A key first step of the training programme for Peer
      Educators was for them to receive psychologist coaching to help them
      understand their own experiences to better help others. Across the
      community, Peer Educators planned and hosted workshops, as well as working
      alongside community partner organisations. Among the cohort receiving the
      intervention, 75% said they would start having more conversations about
      mental health and wellbeing with their family and friends.


      The peer-led approach was piloted between September 2021 and March 2022 in London. It was developed by Safer London on the background of extensive experience working with young Black men and boys and acknowledging the specific challenges this cohort faces. The Peer Educators, who referred to themselves as the ‘Mind the Mandem’ cohort, had lived experience of the challenges faced by young Black men and boys, and were recruited through an innovative recruitment process, which made use of video applications to get a feel for the potential Peer Educator as a person. The Peer Educators were also later provided with support to consider and pursue their future employment. 


      A helpful [professional’s guide](https://saferlondon.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Beyond_the_BanterNOV2022_SMALL.pdf) has been developed to share the process, learning and encourage the approach to be adopted more widely.

    about: "**Laurelle Brown Training and Consultancy (LBTC)** has worked with
      children’s services to develop and embed equity and inclusion across
      systems by developing practice, equipping leaders and enhancing system
      capacities through change to find solutions to complex inequalities. All
      work is underpinned by the fundamental frameworks of anti-racism,
      intersectionality and systems thinking. Founder, Laurelle, has a long
      background working in and alongside children’s services and completed a
      Churchill Fellowship exploring foster carer for adolescents with ‘complex
      needs’. \r

      \r

      One local authority project included a comprehensive Anti-Racism
      audit of children’s social care to support the identification of
      opportunities to improve systems and practice and children and familial
      outcomes. Key recommendations included improvements to the commissioning
      and quality assurance frameworks, establishing clear metrics and goals for
      equity, inclusion and anti-racism, integrating these into audit,
      commissioning and staff training materials and processes; as well as
      review and development of the Resilience practice model to ensure
      anti-racist principles and approaches and the impact of structural
      inequalities for minoritised children, families and staff were referenced
      and supporting inclusive practice. There was also a range of learning and
      development activity delivered, including a bespoke training programme for
      the senior leadership team, a new ‘Confident conversations on race’
      induction course for all staff and a train the trainer course for staff to
      facilitate listening circles to support racialised staff. \r

      \r

      In another local authority, **LBTC** co-developed a tailored
      learning and development programme for children’s social care managers and
      senior leaders to support implementation of a newly published Tackling
      Inequalities Strategy. **LBTC** developed and facilitated training
      sessions to build knowledge and understanding of managers around key
      concepts, and strategies they can implement to tackle inequalities, a
      practitioner service day to support continuity and buy-in, and reflective
      workshops to advise, guide and support the senior leadership team in
      driving and embedding a complex change programme of this nature. The
      collaboration has led to new recruitment approaches being implemented with
      positive representation and diversity results, the introduction of new
      programmes to engage staff and hold Heads of Service to account for
      equalities change and improved outcomes for minoritised children. \r

      benefits that families may qualify for or offer one-on-one application
      assistance. Examples of benefits include: TANF, SNAP, unemployment
      insurance, social security, and VA benefits. 

      * Customize the application assistance and instructions for your area, such as providing necessary translations. 

      * Conduct a parallel process and carry out the licensing process while families are still working to meet the financial requirements. You can complete many steps, like background checks and home study interviews, even if a family member is still working to access additional financial benefits. 

      * Waive the financial requirement for relative placements on a case-by-case basis. Many child welfare systems have an exemption process that allows licensors to bypass the financial requirements for a relative placement if the placement is in the best interests of the child. 

      * Make sure that an exemption process is well-documented and easy for new licensors to learn and follow. 

      * Set a policy eliminating financial requirements for relative placements. There are no minimum financial requirements set by the federal government for foster parents, only that “applicants must be financially stable to meet their family’s needs prior to placing a foster child in the home.” Your state can modify licensing requirements to eliminate asking relative placements for financial information. However, we still believe ensuring the financial stability of traditionally licensed foster homes is a good practice.

      * Resolve minor pending items with photos.

      * Prioritize in-home and community-based fingerprinting. Mobile Livescan units reduce in-person time by allowing you to combine fingerprinting with the final safety walkthrough. Community-based fingerprinting sites like UPS stores remain open as essential businesses and provide a stress-free, fast environment for applicants to complete this requirement. 

      * Eliminate or temporarily suspend other in-person requirements. If your process requires a medical evaluation, allow a medical professional to complete the paperwork based on patients records or via a telehealth visit. 

      * Invest in online solutions that allow families to complete and track paperwork, attend and track orientations and trainings, and upload key documents. 

      * If your child welfare system has a unique requirement, like tuberculosis tests, evaluate whether such a unique requirement is necessary and remove or suspend it if possible.

      ([ccoad@uw.edu](mailto:ccoad@uw.edu)). 

      * Conduct telephone orientations. Washington, D.C. developed an approach for conducting orientation sessions over the phone which was well received by families who attended. The agency provided a PowerPoint [presentation](https://www.childwelfareplaybook.com/assets/CFSA_Recruitment_Orientation_March_2020_Pride.pptx) for attendees to follow along and had a foster parent on the line to offer a real-world perspective.

      * Conduct online orientations. You can use the same slide deck and materials as you would for an in-person orientation, or add an interactive element by using a platform like [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/) to create a [scored quiz](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/7032287?hl=en). If your agency uses [Binti](https://binti.com/), you can provide an online orientation video for families to watch. Afterwards, families can complete a quiz in order to get credit.

      * Convert your own in-person training to online training. If you prefer to use your own training instead of an existing online training, you can convert your materials. 

      * Follow promising practices for online training. In developing their own online training, Michigan identified several promising practices: 

        * Offer an online option for families to connect with one another. You can create a closed Facebook group for each class to help participants build connections and form a support group.
        * Schedule frequent classes. For two-parent households, this will allow parents to more easily switch between attending the training and spending time with children.
        * Keep classes short. A full-day class is often too long for many participants to do online. Build in short breaks throughout the class so that participants don’t disengage.
        * Set online meeting guidelines before the first class. Not all participants will be familiar with online meetings. Guidelines can include general expectations, online meeting manners (i.e. how to dress appropriately, when to mute), and instructions on using the technology. Leave time at the beginning of the meeting to assist with any technical difficulties.
        * Include an interactive element, such as a questionnaire for each session to make sure that parents understand the material as the trainer covers it. Cut any hands-on activities that can’t easily be done remotely. Instead, stop to discuss the material more often. 
        * Cap the class at approximately 20 people to make sure that everyone can engage. 
        * You can contact Jessica Sweet at Michigan DHHS if you have any questions ([SweetJ2@michigan.gov](mailto:SweetJ2@michigan.gov)).
    costs:
      - Low to no cost if using existing online materials
      - Potential cost of online meeting software
      - Potential cost to develop online training materials
    benefits:

      this group.


      An instructive [report ](https://kijiji20.wixsite.com/home/survey-report-2021)published in 2021 highlighted key findings around a lack of fair and equal progression opportunities for BSPs as well as a sense that they faced career barriers as a result of their ethnicity. The report made six key recommendations for the sector. These included commissioning culturally competent independent resources to engage BSPs and provide a ‘safe’ forum to listen to and understand their workplace experiences, carry out workforce audits to assess workforce equality and progression opportunities, ringfenced funding for the commissioning/employment of dedicated ‘Equality, Diversity and Inclusion’ expertise, ringfenced leadership opportunities for BSPs, investment in high-quality learning and development opportunities for BSPs as well as implementing support for BSPs which addresses health inequalities.

    about: >
      Wipers Youth CIC is a social enterprise offering a range of support to
      professionals and young people involved in youth justice, with a focus on
      building anti-discriminatory practice. In the context of a correlation
      between unconscious racial bias and an over-representation of black and
      mixed heritage young men in the criminal justice system, the organisation
      provides [anti-discriminatory practice
      training](https://www.wipers.org.uk/learning-and-development) to youth
      justice teams, with topics including Unconscious Bias, Cultural Competency
      and Anti-Racism training. This has supported teams to acknowledge and
      address how unconscious bias may shape how they interact with young
      people. Through providing important training, development and upskilling
      opportunities, the initiative is also helping to address sector challenges
      related to recruitment and retention.


      The Wipers mentoring programme offers young people a crucial point of support to manage the transition from adolescence to adulthood, using a relationship-based, person-centred approach. Wipers mentors work with those at risk of criminal justice involvement, meeting young people at least once a week over three to six months. They engage with mentees in a range of ways, including partaking in activities and day trips as well as offering support to access local youth services and medical or professional appointments. The focus is on building self-esteem and confidence and helping them to navigate issues across their lives. Wipers report that for 88% of the young people receiving mentoring there has been an improvement in confidence and self-esteem.


      A further programme delivered by Wipers and funded by the London Violence Reduction Unit, the ‘Ether Programme’, provides support to young black and minority ethnic men involved in the criminal justice system. This is an eight session personal development and leadership programme and engages uses in issues around race, identity, self-esteem and confidence, as well as perceptions around masculinity and other stereotypes.

    title: Baby-Box-Project
    about: >
      Warwickshire County Council provide a **Baby Box** to new and expectant
      parents who are care leavers. The **Baby Box** is given to each baby and
      includes essential items like nappies, wipes, baby wash, clothes and a
      thermometer for the baby. There is an additional £200 baby fund to allow
      parents to buy more substantial items they need for the baby. The
      initiative was rolled out in Warwickshire in April 2020, allowing the
      service to maintain relationships with the young parents during Covid by
      dropping off the packages at their doors. Driven by a care experienced
      employee, the initiative aligns with the Council’s ‘Corporate Grandparent’
      responsibility, with an intention to


      support care leavers to look after their babies where they need it and allay fears among some care leavers that they may have their baby taken away.


      The boxes supplement a wider offer for care leaver parents, with Warwickshire putting on events on occasions like Mother’s Day and paediatric first aid training courses, with specialist cooking classes to support weaning also in train. There is also a Young Parents group. The team have also worked with the British Baby Box Company, who provide Baby Box to Scotland who provide baby boxes to every child born in Scotland, to develop Warwickshire’s offer, with a bigger box that the baby can lie and nap in and including a wider array of items. The local authority have now established work with a volunteer led project, Baby Basics Warwick, who will process referrals for the team.


      Warwickshire have supported almost 100 care leavers via this initiative to date, and they hope to engage more local businesses, through their baby box re-launch in January, to contribute so they can broaden the offer. The team have advised other local authorities on adopting a similar model. The project has the added benefit of helping the team to better understand the number of young care leavers who go on to have children, which has helped to improve the local support for care leavers. The initiative has both provided practical support to care leavers but has importantly created a culture of support and trust between this cohort and the local authority.

    title: Care-Leaver-Programme
    about: >+
      Microsoft, in partnership with UBDS and three local authorities has
      launched a **pilot programme to support care leavers across the country**.
      The programme aims to provide 15 care leavers with a 12-week programme of
      mentoring, training, and career development.


      The programme is designed to be relevant, responsive, and empowering for the care leavers, involving them in co-producing and co-delivering the programme as well as being actively involved in the evaluation.


      The programme aims to have a positive impact on the well-being, quality of life, and social inclusion of the care leavers and their community. The programme will also enhance the collaboration and partnership between Microsoft and the local authorities in supporting care leavers and other disadvantaged groups.


      The care leavers will receive guidance, support, and encouragement from a mentor who works at Microsoft and has relevant skills and experience. They will also learn new skills and gain knowledge of career pathways that match their interests and aspirations. They will have the opportunity to participate in fun and meaningful activities and events, such as an ideation workshop and a hackathon,led by UBDS, where they can solve real-world problems and create solutions. They will also earn certifications (where appropriate) that can boost their CV and employability.


       The local authorities that are participating in the programme are Trafford Council, London Borough of Haringey, and Northampton Children’s Trust. Each local authority will select and refer 5 care leavers for the programme. The programme will run from January to April 2024.


      The pilot will be monitored and evaluated throughout, with the feedback and outcomes of the programme used to inform future programmes and initiatives for care leavers and other groups.

    about: >
      In collaboration with TODAY Design, Key Assets Australia, a foster care
      provider, have been working to improve the process of recruiting and the
      support provided for foster carers via a **Carer Journey** initiative. The
      project has involved research to map the carer journey, identify the key
      challenges carers faced and propose a response. With challenges around
      carer recruitment and retention, keys aims of this project are to improve
      engagement with carers and help them to feel better supported in the role.
      The Key Assets Australia team have worked on adapting the initial enquiry
      process, putting together a Can I Foster quiz, as well as working with
      recruitment team to design an approach which focuses on ruling in, rather
      than ruling out enquirers. In response to a sense of disconnection
      reported by foster carers during the assessment process, Key Assets
      Australia have upskilled the recruitment coordinators to become trusted
      advisors who focus on building positive relationships with applicants. The
      assessment process now involves more meaningful interactions, with a
      ‘Midway Meeting’ where applicants, Key Assets Australia and the
      independent assessor meet to assess progress of the assessment, as well as
      review training needs the applicant might have. Other features involve the
      development of ‘Carer Information Sheets’ to improve the consistency of
      information provided about the role and support available. There is also
      consideration on the use of technology to support recruitment of carers
      and conversion tracking, and lead to a more seamless experience for the
      service and applicants. The technology means applicants can avoid entering
      the same data at different stages of the process, the administrative
      elements are reduced for staff and the service is better able to use data
      to improve service provision. The early indications of the project support
      an increase in the number of carer approvals.

    title: The-Cartrefi-Clyd-Initiative
    about: >
      The Isle of Anglesey Council’s **Cartrefi Clyd** initiative provides
      relationship-focused care to looked after children. **Cartrefi Clyd** or
      ‘cosy homes’, have the feel of traditional family homes and are embedded
      within communities in close proximity to other family homes. They were set
      up in response to a lack of suitable local placements, which meant that
      children were often placed miles away from home, often outside of Anglesey
      and across England. Children sometimes did not know where they were and
      felt isolated from their friends, family and local Welsh-speaking
      community.


      Anglesey County Council developed its in-house capacity through a mixture of obtaining existing local authority property and purchasing new properties, funded by Welsh government grants. The Council worked closely with colleagues within the Council and the regulatory body to make sure the model complied with regulatory standards, whilst also ensuring it reflected the council’s trauma-informed approach and that the properties felt like homes, rather than feeling institutional.


      There are now four **Cartrefi Clyd** homes, ranging between one, two and three bedroomed provision. They are available to children aged between nine and eighteen, with careful matching taking place to ensure a suitable mix of children in each home. Staffed 24-hours a day by a small team of residential child care workers, the homes focus on providing a continuity of care for children and ensuring each child receives dedicated time and attention. Staff operate a small rota and an attempt is made to ensure staff members work on the same day every week, to give consistency and reduce stigma children may feel, for example as a result of having different people accompanying them to different activities throughout their week.


      The benefits of this initiative have been wide-ranging. Children have been supported to develop healthy relationships with trusted adults, build important links and find stability within their local community. They have been empowered to input into the decoration of the home, choosing the layout and colour schemes of their bedrooms, for example, and having pets. Older children have been able to build their skills for independent living through a close collaboration between the residential workers and their social workers. The council has also been able to generate cost savings, with children returning from external private placements and moving into **Cartrefi Clyd** homes. There are examples where the cost to the council of one high cost external placement has been the same as two children placed in **Cartrefi Clyd**. Having previously had to travel across to England for visits, social work staff have been able to spend more time working directly with children on Anglesey, as a result of significantly reduced travel time. In addition, residential workers have been encouraged to progress through social work pathways and pursue their interest in and capacity to move into other roles across children and families services.

They have worked with the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham on a pilot to convert two properties into housing for care leavers. It aims to house over 100 people over a 15 year period. In addition, a disused council property has been transformed into a workshop to renovate furniture for young people.


      An adjacent project is also being piloted in Poland. Amid a UK housing crisis which disproportionately impacts young people, this toolkit offers important guidance to stimulate the re-development of unused assets so that communities can benefit and especially to help ensure young people leaving care have access to housing as they embark on their adulthood.

      Skookum Kids, a not-for-profit organisation based in the USA, runs **The
      Landing**. **The Landing** is an emergency shelter for children entering
      foster care for the first time. Set up as a traditional homely
      environment, children typically remain here for 72 hours, allowing their
      situation to stabilise in a calming, secure environment at a critical
      juncture. It also provides crucial time for social workers to be able to
      find the right home to meet the needs of the child, whether it be across
      their kin network or with a foster family. The homes are staffed primarily
      by trained volunteers, often with other full-time jobs. This includes
      those who are keen to foster permanently but their own housing situation
      makes this difficult, getting more people from across the community
      involved in caring for vulnerable children. 


      There are currently two homes open as part of **The Landing**, offering care to hundreds of children every year. It is estimated that the cost of running this initiative is just one fifth of comparable group care facilities. Findings from an evaluation of this approach indicate that children who are placed in these homes are more likely to be housed alongside a sibling during their temporary placement and were more likely to be placed with a relative in their next placement. It also suggests that where a child or young person was housed in a similar centre, the foster carer who goes on to look after them is more likely than other similar foster carers to retain their fostering license as time goes on. The evaluation does not suggest an impact on the number of placements or the time spent in fostering for a child who is initially placed in one of these homes compared to a child who is not. In the context of widespread challenges with placement sufficiency and stability, **The Landing** offers an innovative solution to making sure children entering care are appropriately supported by the right carers, both in the short-term and the longer term.

    about: >
      At the moment, an oppressive cycle exists whereby parents who have
      experience of being in care and their children are overrepresented in the
      safeguarding system. They also have very poor outcomes. This is traumatic
      for families, and very costly for local authorities. In a north London
      borough for example, over 12% of children on child protection plans have a
      care experienced parent; this results in an annual spend of approximately
      £286,000. Almost 15% of children in care in the same local authority have
      a care experienced parent; this results in an annual spend of
      approximately £3,500,000.


      **Create Your Village** aims to empower local authorities to take on their corporate ‘grandparent’ role and break the cycle of intergenerational trauma, by enhancing care experienced parents “village” of informal support. **Create Your Village** will support local authorities to do this by helping them to co-produce a package of bespoke services with care experienced parents in their area, and integrate the support into the local authorities early help offer.

    about: >
      **Why Care** is a new approach to assessing, preparing and supporting
      those who want to be foster carers that draws together the experience of
      those with lived and learned knowledge foster care.


      The purpose of this is to refocus the emphasis on what those with care experience, foster carers and social workers tell us is most important for foster carers to be able to provide stable, loving homes. It will also look to gather more data throughout the process about those who withdraw from the assessment or within the first year and those who continue, so more targeted support and preparation can be offered to foster carers, and LAs can benefit from a deeper understanding of this.


      **Why Care** is initially working with one local authority to pilot the **Why Care’s** proposed new elements of the assessment process. **Why Care** wants to work with all interested parties to improve the current processes for assessment and support to increase the number and readiness of local authority foster carers.

      **Now** **Foster** is a not-for-profit start-up

      seeking to re-imagine the approach to foster carer recruitment, retention and support. It is working to mainstream foster care, which can enable more

      children to live in loving and supportive homes that meet their needs. Foster carer recruitment and retention remain key sector challenges against a backdrop of a rising number of children coming into care and a lack of suitable, local placements. Working with local authorities and charitable IFAs, **Now** **Foster** is focused on changing the perception of fostering and the way in which foster carers are recruited and supported in a bid to expand and

      diversify the pool of foster carers. 


      **Now Foster’s** new service will make use of data analytics to target new groups who have the potential to become foster carers and utilise digital tools to ease the application process. It will also deliver a new wrap-around approach to supporting foster carers which is led by those with experience of foster care or care, with foster carers becoming part of a strong peer network. In the longer term, **Now Foster** wants to work closely with children, young people and foster carers to improve the experience of care and the voice of the child within this. 


      **Now** **Foster** is piloting its recruitment and retention service in the London Borough of Newham. This is particularly focused on recruiting new demographics who have never considered fostering and need support to design fostering-friendly lives. 


      **Key learning from the

      pilot includes:** 


      • We need to proactively help people design a fostering-friendly life → we can do this better by segmenting future foster carers and focusing on very specific groups. 


      • Weekend fostering is a good entry point for new carers → we can provide a dedicated programme to step into fostering via this route. 


      • Some types of fostering can attract those with a family

      building motivation → we can make the most of the family building interest amongst LGBTQ+ and adopters in order to make fostering attractive to them.


       • We need community conversations to normalise fostering → we need a step up in marketing and communication activities, particularly those that maximise opportunities for personal conversations. 


      • The recruitment process needs to excite people to foster → our recruitment experience has been put together with foster carers

      and service designers to achieve this goal. ****

    about: >
      Wirral Council has recently opened **Our Space**, a dedicated hub offering
      support to young people with care experience. The hub- which is based in a
      building the council are leasing from charity the Callister Trust- was
      co-developed with young people, giving them a place of their own where
      they can feel safe and access a wide range of services. There is a
      multi-functional activity space where young people can play pool or
      perform on a small stage, with a sewing room where young people can create
      or upcycle new clothes. Regular group activities are held from the hub,
      including a weekly social evening and a ‘Tea at the Hub’ session where PAs
      cook a meal for young people. There are also private spaces where young
      people can access a counselling service in confidence, without having to
      go to a clinical setting. **Our Space** also has a kitchen and washing
      machine amenities, with a shop on site where young people can pay whatever
      they can afford, with hygiene products, fruit and vegetables available for
      free. The money made in the shop is re-diverted back to the hub. **Our
      Space** also has a popular weekly Stay and Play group for care experienced
      young parents, who may feel apprehensive around attending traditional
      groups in children’s centres or playgroups. The Group is attended by PAs,
      youth workers and the Lifelong Learning team and the parents have
      developed strong friendships and peer support circles outside of the hub.


      **Our Space** works closely with the local college and Department for Work and Pensions, and it also has its own bespoke care leaver employability programme called Get Real, supporting young people through a staged approach of skills development to work experience to employment. Wirral Council pay the young person’s wages to the employer for the first six months employment. Other support delivered from the Hub include a sexual health service and visits from the council’s social housing team, who advise on accommodation options and property bidding. With PAs and duty teams on site, **Our Space** makes it easier for young people to navigate and engage with a range of key services from one place, rather than having to go from service to service. The model in the Wirral has been particularly successful, with other local authorities seeking to follow suit.

    about: >
      Kingston and Richmond Council’s Leaving Care service has pioneered the
      **Prison Box** project which delivers packages of essential items to young
      people in prison. The project was developed following a visit to a young
      person in prison, who fed back to the team that he had been given a towel
      and underwear which had already been used by a number of people. The team
      have worked closely with young people, including those who have come out
      of prison, to define what the packages should include. The core components
      of the packages include tracksuits, socks, underwear, sliders, trainers, a
      large bath towel, first class stamps, duvets, mattress protector, pillows
      and bed sets, a curtain for privacy, although the packages can be
      personalised to the young person. The team also provides young people with
      books, enabling them to contribute and feedback comments via letter to a
      wider service book club. Careful consideration has been given to the
      nature of the items, for example providing non-branded, plain clothing as
      young people were worried branded items may be stolen. Given that some
      prisons only accept two packages every year for each young person, the
      project requires the team to collaborate closely with the family and
      friends to maximise what each young person can receive.


      A **Prison Box** is now a standard offer for care leavers in Kingston and Richmond, with the team also providing packages to young people in hospital. Some other London local authorities have also taken the project forward, with the intention of developing it as a pan-London offer for young care leavers and the backing of the Reducing Reoffending Lead for London prisons. With positive feedback from the young people receiving a **Prison Box**, the project is hoped to contribute to longer-term better outcomes for young care leavers, who understand they are being listened to and valued by their local authority support service.

    about: >
      As part of its **Take a Breath** model, Manchester City Council has
      created two specialist children’s homes, focusing on supporting children
      with complex needs locally. The homes were developed in view of the lack
      of suitable residential provision for children with complex needs coming
      out of hospital, meaning children were spending weeks in hospital as their
      needs could not be met in the community, even though they did not require
      clinical care. It followed lengthy inpatient stays of five children in
      Manchester, some of which led to court intervention, as residential
      providers refused placements.


      The first home opened in March 2023 and is able to care for up to four children. The homes will allow children who have been hospitalised in a mental health emergency to be discharged from hospital quickly into these homes following treatment for their injuries. They will also have a hospitalisation prevention aim, as well as addressing issues of multiple placement breakdowns.


      Taking a person-centred, strengths based, trauma informed approach, they will be staffed by two full time workers, who will work with children to settle them through a period of stress. The service seeks to provide short to medium term provision to ease children into the next stage of their care pathway.


      There was also a financial imperative for the council to create this provision, with private providers charging tens of thousands of pounds every week to look after these children in some cases. These homes, commissioned by the council in collaboration with the NHS, will cost £5,500 per child per week.

      The **Always There for Us** project is a pilot programme that aims to
      improve the mental health and wellbeing of young men in the Bruce Grove
      area of Haringey, London. The project is run by Project Future, a charity
      that provides psychological support to young people in the UK. The pilot
      programme involves embedding psychologists within a youth club to provide
      counselling and support to young men affected by offending. The
      psychologists work with young men at Bruce Grove youth club in Haringey,
      supporting them with their mental wellbeing and providing training, advice
      and support to the youth workers there.


      The pilot programme reported a number of benefits. By deploying mental health workers in a youth club they were able to reach young people who would not normally trust mental health services. Through using game-based activities to engage and educate young men about their wellbeing, the pilot led to a new openness about mental health. The project uniquely combined the complementary skills of psychologists and youth workers, and reduced the stigma associated with mental health. The project contributed to an increased understanding about mental health and wellbeing amongst the young men and led to them having more confidence around discussing their emotions and seeking help. They project also provided a safe space to discuss anxieties and concerns about gangs, racism and school pressures. There is a recommendation around other mental health services providing similar access to psychological support via youth clubs.

      Working across Cornwall, the project involves a multi-agency professional team (from across health, social care, CAMHS and the third sector) coming together to formulate a holistic plan to support each young person with their emotional, social and mental wellbeing. Children and young people are represented at the meeting by a nominated professional of their choice. The support plan draws upon a range of provision and makes use of local community and voluntary projects. Each of the six localities in Cornwall has oversight of how the model operates locally, with a central **Bloom** Cornwall-wide Steering Group. Young people are also sometimes provided with a HeadStart Youth Facilitator to support them with activities and access to support. The Bloom model and process underwent a comprehensive [evaluation ](https://www.headstartkernow.org.uk/Learning/Bloom%20evaluation/Bloom%20Executive%20Report%20FINAL.pdf)in 2020/21, which included a cost-benefit analysis, engagement with a wide range of stakeholders, and a data and analysis comparison report between 2019 and 2020. The report recognised the unique value of having a child-centred professional consultation model, which is agile, responsive and cost effective. A key part of the model was the involvement in Bloom meetings of a CAMHS Clinical Psychologist and a Primary Mental Health Worker, with a sense that without **Bloom**, there would be a greater number of CAMHS referrals.

      children and young people. It is a part of the partnership’s longstanding
      commitment to help prevent future serious injury or harm to children.


      The toolkit applies to all contexts of child and family practice and provides practical, online child protection guidance and training for students and trainees, front-line practitioners, designated safeguarding leads; managers, senior leaders, academics, and the judiciary. The toolkit includes animations, bite-size and e-learning modules with up-to-date legislation, guidance, and practice resources, all drawing on learning from both local and national Serious Case Reviews (SCRs), many highlighted in the first annual report of the National Child Safeguarding Practice Review Panel. It also covers the new requirements to undertake Child Safeguarding Practice Reviews under Working Together 2018.


      The resources and e-learning modules are based on 10 key safeguarding principles to support all those confronted with child neglect and abuse, or young people being exploited and going missing. The course details 10 case scenarios that draw on the real lived experiences of children, based on some of the most commonly repeated SCR themes. Domestic abuse and violence is a feature in many of these SCRs. The e-learning has been split into four levels, each representing the varying degrees of responsibility and knowledge that individuals have in their current role.

      organisations, Peel X and Challenge Kit. Peel X is an immersive content
      agency based in Yorkshire, specialising in all forms of digital/XR and
      drama-based story-telling methods. Challenge Kit is an experienced team of
      leaders, teachers, and facilitators based in the West Midlands, who have
      developed ‘Learning Outside the Classroom’ programmes designed to achieve
      a range of outcomes. Gamechanger uses cutting-edge technology, such as
      virtual reality and online interactive games, to create immersive learning
      platforms. At the same time, it also utilises traditional drama-based
      learning and the best parts of more traditional ‘Outside of the Classroom’
      principles. The project aims to create a unique training and education
      platform that has multiple use cases across the education sector and other
      industries.


      **Gamechanger** is designed to be engaging, educational, and facilitate behaviour change. The project is scalable and based on real-life situations, and it is anticipated that the technology will provide educators, local authorities, social services, and child protection agencies with a valuable library of assets for safeguarding children and young people.

      across Kent. The service is funded by Headstart and Kent Reconnect.


      It is aimed at those not accessing specialist services but experiencing increased anxiety, poor mental health or social isolation due to the pandemic. Salus uses a strengths-based approach to supporting children, young people, and their families. It deploys a range of evidence-based approaches and tools (such as the FRIENDS resilience programme) and facilitates the development of a trusted relationship with a mentor. Salus works to understand individual needs and create an action plan to deal with these with the young person and their family.


      Mentors provide approximately six to eight weeks of direct support, with each young person having a conversation about their resilience and complete a self-reflection assessment before referral. As a result of the resilience support offered, children have been able to manage their anxiety better and develop their confidence. Salus were finalists in the CYPN awards in the ‘Mental Health & Wellbeing’ category.

      Lambeth are delivering a pilot with South London and the Maudsley (SLaM)
      NHS Trust, and community organisations (The Well Centre, Coram and
      Place2Be) to better understand how we can join up our response to children
      and young people’s emotional health and wellbeing need, bringing services,
      data and statutory provision together.


      The Well Centre is a health centre located at the Herne Hill Group Practice that provides young people aged 11-20 with open access to GPs, counsellors, and health & wellbeing practitioners in one place. The centre assesses the needs of presenting young people via a holistic assessment called the Teen Health Check. The pilot will build on the work of the Well Centre and scale and/or replicate this


      model to extend its availability across the borough. The pilot aims to seamlessly transition young people to the relevant services once their needs have been assessed. The two-year pilot has been developed to measure how Lambeth’s mental health services can work with third-party providers to create a joined-up offer for young people in the borough, with the long-term aim of reducing demand on Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) . The total budget of £400k has already been approved, and two voluntary sector providers have been appointed to deliver the pilot – Coram and Place2Be. The pilot will ensure developments are aligned with work in schools and other areas of early help and prevention.


      The pilot aims to provide a seamless service for young people accessing mental health and wellbeing support in Lambeth. It aims to enable service providers to share, when necessary, the information describing the needs of the young person so that when a young person moves to a different service, they receive the best support they need quickly and without having to tell their story repeatedly. The pilot will track the outcomes for young people accessing the services covered by this pilot to determine the effectiveness of those services at meeting the young person’s needs and, in the long term, reducing the proportion of young people with severe or acute mental health needs. The main work strands of the pilot include mapping existing preventative and early intervention services and the referral pathways between them and also CAMHS. The pilot will work with third sector organisations and define the services they offer.

      The **Living Assessments** project is a five-year research programme
      funded by the Wellcome Trust and based jointly at the University of Kent,
      Cambridge, and the National Children’s Bureau. The project aims to
      understand the experiences and impact of health and social care
      assessments on children, young people, and families, particularly those
      who are affected by disability or are in need of social care support. The
      research draws on four key sources: analysis of health, social care,
      benefits, and educational records from over 350,000 participants; three
      “experts by experience” groups, comprising disabled children and
      adolescents, care leavers, and parents of those who have undergone
      assessments; interviews with people who were instrumental in developing
      the Children Act 1989 legislation, professionals who have conducted social
      care assessments, and children and young people who have themselves
      experienced these assessments; and archival research of key documents
      relating to the 1989 Children Act.


      The project looks at the decision-making process for providing social care support to children and families, the impact of offering particular support or not offering that support, and the lived experiences of assessments. The research aims to ensure engagement with civil servants, parliamentarians, policy makers, and senior practitioners, in collaboration with MPs and Peers from the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Children (APPGC) and influence evidence-based changes.

      Based on attachment theory, **Promoting** **First Relationships**®
      (**PFR**) is a brief, 10-week evidence-based, home-visiting intervention
      programme pioneered in the USA. It has been designed to support better
      infant mental health and aid brain development, giving parents the skills
      and knowledge to support their child’s emotional and social development. A
      central premise of attachment theory is that for optimal growth and
      development it is critical to feel safe and supported. Supporting families
      birth-five, **PFR** is unique because it trains providers to use unedited
      video recordings of the caregiver-child interaction to support caregivers
      in connecting to and understanding their child’s social and emotional
      needs through reflective observation. The results of **PFR** across
      multiple populations speak to its capacity to support caregivers as they
      learn to understand and support their child’s social and emotional needs.


      **PFR** has been evaluated with a randomised control design in six different populations (one trial is still ongoing, Oxford et al., 2023); three in child welfare (Spieker et al., 2012; Oxford et al., 2016; Oxford et a., 2023), two within rural Native American communities (Booth La-Force et al., 2020; Booth La-Force 2022), and one with newborns in a perinatal mental health setting for both Spanish and English-speaking mothers (Oxford et al., 2021). In all five completed studies PFR improved observed caregiver sensitive and responsive care, caregiver knowledge of social and emotional development, and a range of child outcomes including behavioral problems (Paslish et al., 2016; Oxford et al., 2016; Oxford et al., 2021) and improved stress physiology (Nelson & Spieker, 2012; Hastings et a., 2018) as well as social attention in a study of children at risk for autism spectrum disorder (Jones et al., 2017). In the two completed child welfare studies, **PFR** prevented foster care placements for toddlers in the Child Protective Service population by 2.5 times (Oxford et al., 2016) and improved permanency outcomes for children in foster and kin care (Spieker et a., 2014).

      widely. The project was based in HALT, a statutory service in Glasgow for
      children and young people who have displayed HSB.


      The **ROSA** Project worked with 68 young people at risk of HSB allowing them access to the Inform Young People programme. This programme involved 6–10 sessions of one-to-one early intervention psychoeducational support.


      In addition to direct work with young people in Glasgow who had displayed TA-HSB, the **ROSA** Project was supplemented with wider proactive and capacity-building work with a secondary school in Glasgow. The project was evaluated by the Children and Young People’s Centre for Justice (CYCJ) at the University of Strathclyde. The findings of the project include positive outcomes associated with ROSA, including a reduction in risk, changed behaviours and reduced criminalisation. There was also a sense that young people had improved their knowledge and grown in confidence when it came to using the internet, although there were some reservations around whether they could implement their knowledge in practice in the longer term. The intention is to use the lessons learned to improve awareness of the programme and develop the work with schools.

      **Amelia VR** is an innovative virtual reality tool, designed to enable
      mental health professionals to deliver high-quality services to their
      patients. The platform includes over 100 virtual environments and scenes,
      meaning professionals can gear the sessions towards the needs of the
      patient and create an appropriate, personalised therapeutic environment.
      In addition to boosting flexibility, VR has the added benefit of allowing
      the patient to immerse themselves in therapy in a unique way without
      distraction, and repeat specific scenes. Outside of the sessions, patients
      can also use the platform to undertake relaxation and mindfulness
      activities. Prior to using the tools, the Amelia Virtual Care Academy
      programme trains therapists in appropriate use of the platform.

    about: >
      The **Invision360** platform offers an array of tools that empower local
      authorities to make improvements to the standard of care they provide to
      children with SEND or in care.


      These award-winning tools have been developed in partnership with local authorities to drive improvements in quality for Education Health and Care Plans (EHCPs), EHCP Annual Reviews, EHCP Health reports (QHA), Personal Education Plans, and statutory Educational Psychology Advice that informs children’s EHC assessments.


      The **Invision360** tools are frequently mentioned in CQC and Ofsted Inspection letters, which acknowledge their contribution to the improved quality of EHCPs for local authorities. All the tools guide the user through a user-friendly interface, a step-by-step process, built-in checklist criteria, and examples of good practice. The technology used in these tools helps local authority teams to analyse trends, progress towards outcomes, identify areas for improvement, and evidence improvement cycles.


      With over 45 Local authorities having adopted the tools, the benchmarking feature enables partners to compare their performance with others nationally and regionally. The tools are reported to have contributed to a 50% reduction in the time it takes for a plan to be audited


      The child or young person's voice is collected through experiential feedback links; local authorities collate and analyse first hand user experiences from children/young people and parents/carers following engagement with services, which helps in building an overall picture.


      **Invision 360** are broadening their menu of tools available to local authorities, with tools to support safeguarding and social care in development. Working with data scientists, using innovative machine learning techniques, the Invision360 team are also building SEND tools to further increase efficiencies and good practice.

    about: >
      Aberdeen City Council have used **Microsoft Dynamics 365** Customer
      Service to improve the way the council collects and uses data to provide a
      better service to residents. The system has allowed social care workers to
      collate all the key information they need expediently to develop a clear
      record of people in their care, rather than the arduous task of collating
      data and information from a number of separate sources and departments.
      This was time consuming and could promote errors in the transfer of key
      information from one source to another.


      With **Dynamics 365 Customer Service**, the Council have created a central database to store information, with the system automatically able to map and update relationships and interactions between people. As a result, a cross-cutting and holistic picture of the person and their history can be generated, with police, medical professionals and other partners also able to access this.


      The team at Microsoft worked closely with the Council to make sure the solution was bespoke to their needs. It is estimated that through **Dynamics 365 Customer Service**, Aberdeen City Council can save over £2 million per year due to time and effort saved, and deliver a faster, better service. The handling time per case has been reduced to an average of 218 minutes, allowing the council to take on 11,500 new referrals and complete over 3,000 new assessments every year. It has enabled the service to be more proactive and preventative in their approach, rather than being reactive. As part of a three year partnership with Microsoft, the council aim to add further capabilities into the system, integrating educational psychology data and providing a function for service users to add their own notes and information into the system, as well as exploring how machine learning can help to predict needs.

    about: >
      In the ever-evolving landscape of children’s services, the Adoption East
      Midlands (AEM) and Antser (Cornerstone) partnership is pioneering a
      ground-breaking approach to support adoptive parents from assessment
      through to adoption support.


      Since its inception in 2019, the Regional Adoption Agency has been utilising Antser (Cornerstone)’s immersive Virtual Reality (VR) technology to transform the adoption process, with an objective to foster empathy and enhance understanding, particularly when dealing with the complexities of adoption and developmental trauma.


      Initially, AEM utilised VR on a needs-led basis, assisting families struggling to connect with their adopted children's experiences and complex concepts like brain development and internal working models. Witnessing positive results, AEM's commitment to VR deepened, with practitioners leading its integration into assessments, matching, and support for all families.






      Furthermore, AEM embedded the VR into a new trauma-informed Therapeutic Parenting Course, promoting not only understanding of therapeutic parenting but also fostering peer connections among parents. In parallel AEM developed a trauma-informed Adoption Placement Report and Adoption Support Planning process, which follows the journey of one of the children in the VR films, allowing practitioners to bring the child’s experiences to life, facilitating discussion from the child’s perspective.


      One adopter who experienced the VR shared the following feedback:


      “It was useful to get a background understanding of some of the potential reasons children may have reluctant attitudes to things like personal hygiene and hair washing. What seems like a day-to-day simplicity for us could be a genuine trigger for them. It’s important to bear this in mind if any such behaviours are displayed, it’s not just the child being “naughty”.”


      The partnership has proved highly successful. One notable case study portrays how VR was used to help two people parenting very differently from one another in the same household. This had a negative impact on the family’s environment and children’s behaviour. This difficult situation was further exacerbated as the children had complex needs, which caused additional stress and dysfunction. The insight from the VR training enabled both parents to better co-parent. It allowed


      them to see things from a different perspective, moving from an antagonistic style of co-parenting to a complimentary style of co-parenting; improving their personal relationship as well as their relationship with the children. They were able to identify and remedy problems and changes were seen almost instantly. The improved environment meant their placement remained stable, avoiding further distress or trauma.


      As the adoption landscape advances, AEM stands at the forefront, using VR to transform not only the adoption process but also the lives of aspiring adoptive parents and the children they welcome into their homes. With their innovative approach, AEM and Antser (Cornerstone) are creating a more empathetic, informed, and supportive adoption community.

    about: >
      Portsmouth City Council has made transformational changes to the way they
      have used their data and moved to more collaborative partner working in
      their Children’s Services over the last 18 months.


      Portsmouth’s **Data Platform** went live in March 2022, with the integration of data from over 40 different systems and partner agencies to create a complete view of their children’s lives and immediate families. This was the enabler to begin to use data more proactively and share more confidently.


      The first service innovation added onto the **Data Platform** was their Vulnerable Pupil Tracking Portal (VPT). This is a secure online portal, shared with schools. It provides each school with their own data feeds and dashboards, which enables early identification of children who may have additional vulnerabilities. This allows effective plans of support to be implemented more quickly. Children who are then highlighted as being vulnerable are discussed on a fortnightly basis with their LA Education Link Coordinator to ensure effective oversight. The portal allows schools and local authority users to see all information relating to a child in one place, which saves users time from having to look at various databases. The child’s golden record includes data on attendance, exclusions, safeguarding teams, youth justice service, exploitation levels, SEN needs and other vulnerability factors. Schools report that this is an amazing resource for them, helping them in their daily work and to keep on top of safeguarding for children. This VPT also now holds Early Help support plans for the child and family, through online data collection and collaboration of support information against a centralised Family Support Plan. Overview reports and dashboards allows Service Managers and the Supporting Families Team to access the information to build this into their support work.


      In summer 2023, the **Data Platform** was extended further, providing fully profiled views of families across the city for the Supporting Families Team, via their own Supporting Families (Phase 3) Portal. This Portal can automatically identify those families who are eligible for attachment as part of the Supporting Families National Programme (within the DLUHC National Outcomes Framework), as well as families who qualify for successful turnaround status.


      Recently, a Neuro Diversity Profiling Portal has been added to the list of services. This provides an on-line first step in identifying neurodiversity in children and young people (aged 0-19) across the city, to help establish what additional support needs or learning difficulties a young person may have.


      The **Data Platform** is also the basis for a Data Science proof-of-concept project, using Machine Learning models to look for early signs of a child becoming more vulnerable to becoming a Looked After Child in the future. The objective is to focus Early Help support activities as early as possible to prevent crisis, make families stronger / more resilient, and reduce the number of children being taken into care.


      Portsmouth will also complete the implementation of a new MET / GANGS Portal, to give them more immediate understanding of children who are potentially Missing, Exploited or Trafficked, or who are linked to a gang or gang culture.


      Hayden Ginns, AD for Children's Services for PCC and Portsmouth Place (NHS) says: ‘The new technology has enabled professionals in the city to appropriately (and legally) share vital information about children across agency boundaries. Local and national reviews into the safeguarding of children when things go awry nearly always point to a lack of appropriate sharing of information - both in terms of the right information and sharing early enough to prevent harm. This is often a practice issue. But technology can be a major factor in improving how services work together for the benefit of children and families. For example, we learnt early on that schools do not always know who a child's social worker is. Just that simple exchange of information can make a major difference to the quality of safeguarding children.’

      Recognising the importance of centring the child’s voice in their records,
      **Mind Of My Own** has created a range of digital tools which enable
      children to share their views, wishes and feelings with people who are
      there to support them. **Mind Of My Own** develops co-produced, fully
      accessible digital products for capturing voice of children. These include
      the **Mind Of My Own One App**, which creates a safe digital space for
      young people aged 8 and over to communicate their views and needs to those
      they are working with, and **Mind Of My Own Express**, which focuses on
      ensuring children with additional needs have their voices heard.


      They are driving change in child centred practice:


      · by creating accessible user centred products that fit into children and young people’s lives.


      · providing excellent customer service while always keeping the end user in mind


      · facilitating a strong community of support where practitioners come together to share and learn in the quest to develop truly child centred communities.


      In the UK their apps are used across over 450 education, social care, youth justice and health services. The apps give children and young people agency in shaping how their story is reflected, providing an authenticity and supporting life story work. One young person reflected that ‘Mind Of My Own has really helped me to be able to share my voice and to feel heard... I find it really useful especially in difficult times as I can access it at 8 in the morning or 3am and write down all my worries and I can then talk about this at my next meeting or with my worker.’


      They also have the additional benefit of saving practitioner administration time- an estimated eight days per social worker per year- as it reduces the need for notes to be transcribed. An OFSTED report in Sunderland reflected that the tool was effective in terms of supporting return home interviews after children go missing, as well as involving younger children in care planning. In addition, **Mind Of My Own** have a number of other apps designed to boost engagement with young people and their families.

    about: >
      North Yorkshire Council are pursuing an innovative pilot project exploring
      how a new technology solution could help to **improve children’s services
      case management to support social workers to keep children safe**. The
      project is being funded by the Department for Education’s Children’s
      Social Care Digital and Data Solutions Fund and supported by the CII and
      partners at Microsoft.


      Local authorities have to navigate a mass of data and information as they seek to ensure the children in their care are able to receive the best possible support. This can be complex and time-consuming, taking social workers away from vital time spent with children and families. North Yorkshire’s case management solution seeks to address these challenges.


      Using analytics tools, the system will be able to efficiently search and analyse data and information across different sources and systems so that children’s services providers have immediate and easy access to the key information about a child or family at the click of a button. The semantic search function can importantly operate across both structured data sources and unstructured data, for example written case notes or written assessments, and extract the key elements for the user.


      The team at North Yorkshire have also been keen to target the tool towards creating comprehensive genograms and ecomaps, which will provide a map of the important people and places in a child’s life, and help identify those who can help to keep a child safe and those who may pose a risk. This will assist social workers to take better, more proactive decisions to protect local children, and also help to keep children connected to their local, community networks. This could have a transformative impact for children going into the care system, for example, by making social workers aware of a neighbour or a family friend who the child knows and trusts and who could provide care to the child for a period of time.


      In addition, North Yorkshire is looking at how it can utilise existing smart technology to create fit-for-purpose systems designed for the social workers of today and the future, for examples exploring the potential for voice notes to become a key part of how practitioners record information about a child.


      In order to create a tool that works for children, families and practitioners, the Council has conducted extensive user research work to inform development, including garnering an understanding of difficulties with existing case management systems, the key features local authorities would welcome in a case management system and exploring potential use cases for the tool both within and beyond children’s social care. The team have also shared key learning from the project along the way, especially to support other teams to negotiate complexities around data and information sharing.


      The team are aiming for a prototype tool to be available in early 2024, which will be piloted with service users and tweaked according to feedback. The aim is for a revised product to be produced by spring 2024, alongside a guidance framework, evaluation and recommendations paper.


      The potential of this tool is vast, with opportunities identified including supporting those children and young people at transition points in the sector, enabling a comprehensive single view of the child and helping services to better understand trends and patterns and translate these into service improvements.


      Pioneered in North Yorkshire, the intention is for the project to contribute to wider policy improvements and for the tool to become something that can be readily adopted by other local authorities and services to scale the transformative impact for children, young people and families.

      **SageSurfer** is a digital care coordination platform, focused on
      behavioural and mental health care. This patient-centred, team-based model
      aims to make it easier for patients, families, healthcare providers and
      community support providers to communicate and ensure that necessary
      actions are taken to support the patient’s care plan. Creating a unique
      care team involving healthcare providers, the patient and the patient’s
      own community of peers, family and friends, this AI-driven tool is
      integrated with health records and supports professionals to monitor
      progress between visits and identify and manage risk. Patients receive an
      assessment and can be directed towards self-care activities and local
      support via the tool. They can also communicate directly with their health
      care team via video, audio or a chat function. Personalised to the
      patient, it is able to support patients with complex mental health issues
      but **Sagesurfer** also work closely with schools and universities to
      build care teams from an early stage in a patient’s journey. The app is
      currently being used with around 4000 patients and **SageSurfer**
      estimates that the tool reduces emergency department visits by 35%, with
      patient engagement rates between 85-90%.

      online, live workshops to children aged between 3-11 years old. These
      interactive, engaging workshops, which are streamed into classrooms using
      Zoom, help children to understand how they can keep their body healthy and
      look after their emotional wellbeing and mental health. They can be
      tailored according to the needs of the school but may include education on
      healthy foods, the importance of physical activity, understanding how to
      deal with feelings and how to be aware of and check their emotional needs
      to support mental wellbeing.


      **SCARF Live Online** complements CLE’s wider SCARF programme and resource bank, which is used by over 50,000 teachers across the country and supports PSHE and wellbeing education in primary schools in line with DfE requirements. By pivoting to online delivery through these innovative workshops, schools were able to continue to benefit from SCARF resources during the pandemic, with SCARF Live Online reaching 763 schools between September 2020 and June 2023 and working with over 132,000 children.

      people and their families. With the content aligned to NICE guidelines and
      co-produced with children, the platform encompasses the prevention,
      assessment and treatment phases of the mental health experience and has
      been used as part of a wider CAMHS offer. The platform has tailored
      programmes for children aged between 5 and 18, with a number of modules,
      each with interactive content providing advice, exercises and hints and
      tips for managing anxiety and low mood. **SilverCloud** report that up to
      65% of its users have achieved a clinically significant improvement in
      their symptoms. In 2023, there was an evaluation of the use of a digital
      CBT service in Ireland and one component of the service was the use of
      SilverCloud. The study reported that the digital CBT tool was associated
      with reductions in symptoms related to anxiety and depression, albeit
      across a wider age group above age 18. **SilverCloud** was also delivered
      to children and young people across Cumbria charity Carlisle Eden Mind,
      with findings that the use of platform has helped the service to reach
      three times as many children and young people. In this service,
      **SilverCloud** is used in addition to face-to-face support where it is
      appropriate for the child or young person, and the platform has enabled
      them to support around 90 children, whereas through previous methods it
      was around 30.


      Amid lengthy CAMHS waiting lists, **SilverCloud** offers important interim support to help young people manage their symptoms and enable services to access and help a larger number of young people.

      The **Teams Youth App** was created by Microsoft in collaboration with the
      Department of Children and Family Services in the Illinois. The App helps
      children, young people, families, caseworkers and other partners involved
      in the case to better communicate with each other. By creating a trusted
      platform where all the relevant parties can be contacted at once, the App
      helps each party to coordinate services and support for children and young
      people more efficiently and reliably. Families can post questions on the
      app that the social worker can respond to on the go, even if they’re not
      in the office. On a practical level, social workers can save
      administrative time by coordinating meetings in one place, meaning they
      can focus on different areas of their practice. Importantly, the app can
      also empower young people to communicate to their team in a more
      accessible and less threatening way. Feedback from all stakeholders has
      been positive and demonstrates the value of rethinking how we can apply
      existing technology for a greater benefit.

      services professionals and technology experts in 2020, focused on
      supporting local authorities to better meet their obligations to those in
      care and care leavers around preparing for successful independence. Hosted

      to schedule, track and prioritise key activities for completion. This
      co-produced approach between young people and their worker empowers young
      people to play an active role in their care and skills development. The
      tool creates a visual timeline demonstrating a young person’s status and
      progress, which can be viewed by professionals, management, parents/carers
      and young people, creating transparency and accountability in the process.
      Automated email reminders also notify professionals of upcoming activities
      they need to complete for a young person. It aims to enhance joint working
      procedures by streamlining the process for updating other stakeholders,

      theory, **Woebot** uses AI natural language processing to provide a space
      to talk about mental health and wellbeing at the click of a button,
      whenever it suits the user. It was developed by clinical research
      psychologist Alison Darcy.


      With regular conversations and check-ins, **Woebot** is able to gain an insight into the person and their challenges, and provide personalised advice and guiding them towards suitable clinically tested tools and tactics. This advanced chatbot acknowledges the sentiment and provides encouraging, empathetic and personalised responses and shares practical tips and techniques, for example, around mother and baby bonding. The app is currently only available in the USA but data on its impact is promising. A Stanford University study indicated that the app supported a reduction in anxiety and depression among those aged 18-65 years old compared to the control group. The company has also devised treatments specifically designed for teenagers with a diagnosis of mild to moderate depression and new mothers facing post-partum mental health challenges. A recent study suggested that **Woebot** contributed to a reduction in symptoms of depression that were similar to those associated with clinician-led telehealth CBT.


      **Woebot** won the Best Overall Mental Health Solution award at the MedTech Breakthrough Awards programme. Amid growing pressures on mental health services and notwithstanding the importance of in-person therapeutic care, it is clear that technology can play a role in providing timely access to support for those struggling.

      determined by the State) in relative foster family homes for specific

      * If you currently allow _some_ exceptions, change this to allow all non-safety issues. Do not have a specific list of relative exceptions. 

      * If you don't currently allow any licensing exceptions for relatives, start! Use states that already have this flexibility, listed below, as a guide (and feel free to reach out to us for help). 

      * Carefully define "safety" and "non-safety." This trips up many systems. If a kinship caregiver is safe enough to place, then by definition, any other issues are non-safety issues. A safety issue is only something that would cause you to immediately remove a child from that person's care. Under this definition, **ALL** kinship caregivers with placement should qualify for a license. 

      * Acknowledge there will be a small handful of exceptions. You may have a kinship caregiver with a disqualifying federal criminal history but is a court-ordered placement. In this case, the caregiver won't be eligible for IV-E reimbursement. But this should be an extremely rare situation.

      2 ways technology can help reduce the admin burden for social care
      professionals by Kenya McKenzie-Jones, Senior Digital Strategist,
      Microsoft.


      Imagine if you could spend more time in direct work with children and young people? In a recent survey, more than half of Social Workers felt they didn’t have enough time to spend with service users, with high administrative loads cited as a major source of stress1. How can you harness the power of technology to reduce your admin burden?


      **Microsoft 365 Copilot** is integrated into the apps you already use every day, freeing you to focus on the most important work and less on the busy work. Agencies like the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services are already using Microsoft Teams to better collaborate with children, families and case workers. Taking this one step further, **Microsoft 365 Copilot** can work alongside care professionals to unlock productivity. Here’s 2 ways Copilot can free up time and effort for social care professionals:


      1. Report writing. Get help drafting your supervision notes and inspection reports – no need to start from scratch. Copilot in Word writes, edits, summarises, and creates right alongside you. With only a brief prompt, Copilot in Word will create a first draft for you, bringing in information from across your organisation as needed. Copilot can add content to existing documents, summarise text, and rewrite paragraphs to make it more concise.

      1. Multi-agency collaboration. Need help keeping track of emails across your multi-disciplinary teams? Copilot in Outlook works with you in your inbox and messages so that you can spend less time on email triage and more time on communicating – better, faster, and more easily. Summarise lengthy, convoluted email threads with multiple people, and quickly find open questions that have yet to be answered. Respond to an existing email with a simple prompt, or turn quick notes into crisp professional messages.


      The responsible use of AI technology can free up time and effort for Social Care teams, creating more capacity for direct work. Microsoft 365 Copilot is guided by AI principles and Responsible AI Standard, designed to put the human user in control.

      **Double Discrimination: Black care experienced young people** navigating
      the criminal justice system, was commissioned by Barnardo’s Care Journeys
      and, conducted by Listen Up, to hear from Black care experienced young
      people in prisons about their experiences navigating the criminal justice
      system. The report presents a challenge, that ‘we cannot hide the obvious
      and nor should you’, with a key finding being that racism was the major
      determinant in the lives of 20 out of the 22 Black care experienced young
      people who contributed to the research. The findings outline that Black
      care experienced young people are subject to a double whammy of
      discrimination linked to the colour of their skin and their time in care.
      This intersection was rarely factored into their support and not
      recognised. This results in Black care experienced young people facing
      greater hardship than their White peers when navigating life, care and
      importantly, the criminal justice system.


      Recommendations from the report are; (1) improve the experiences of Black children in foster care; (2) improve access to mental health support for Black children in care; (3) take action to reduce the over-criminalisation of children in the care system; (4) improve understanding across agencies of the needs of children in care and care-experienced young people as well as providing training on how to better address these need and (5) ensure a renewed emphasis on implementing reform aimed at tackling institutional racism within the criminal justice system.


      The Barnardo’s report was launched in partnership with Manchester Metropolitan Universities, who had produced a unique quantitative report ‘Care Experience, Ethnicity and Youth Justice Involvement: Key Trends and Policy Implications, each supported respective findings. Following this, a parliamentary roundtable was held chaired by Barnardo’s Vice President Baroness Floella Benjamin to discuss the report’s findings and put forward recommendations to politicians and key decision makers.

      **Care Crates** is an initiative driven by care experienced young people
      with an aim to put the ‘care back into the care system’. It focussed on
      the key issue that young people did not have the right resources to hand
      when leaving the care system. The initiative attracted the attention from
      Ikea, a Barnardo’s corporate partner at the time, who invested £50,000 to
      enable Care Crates to be disseminated across all four nations to
      Barnardo’s services that support those leaving care. The **Care Crates**
      provide some key essentials when setting up a home, but also some more
      sentimental items, like a personalised card, a book that someone has
      personally recommended and a phone card to allow the young person to keep
      in touch with those important to them. Over 200 **Care Crates** have been
      sent to services and an evaluation is planned in early 2024 to measure
      impact. Initial feedback from young people is that they are making a
      difference during what many experience as a difficult transition in their

      experience and are therefore best placed to do so. The training aims to
      raise awareness and inform practice for all professionals across the care
      system regardless of job role. The training, which is delivered to those
      who work directly with those living in and leaving care and other relevant
      professionals, covers areas that are often ignored. This includes for
      example, the impact of language and how to care for Afro Caribbean hair
      and skin. It has already changed professionals thinking and practice
      within Barnardo’s, and it is currently being scaled up to be delivered to

      **Brent Care Journeys (BCJ)** worked with a newly formed Company of care
      experienced young people and the Kiln Theatre to produce creative and
      expressive works to express home some key messages cleaned from their life
      experiences. ‘Dear Social Services’ was a collection of photography, art
      installations, poetry (Poem) and performances presented in an unfiltered
      manner so young people could illustrate their own words, feelings and
      emotions. Those invited to the exhibition included care experienced young
      people, Barnardo’s officers, Brent Council officers and other key decision
      makers in the region. The excellent exhibition encouraged, professionals
      to question their own practice and affirmed the experiences of those with
      lived experience.

      * Include a mix of contents, some practical and some just fun. Consider
      the whole family (the parents, the youth in care, and any children or
      other adults already in the home - perhaps even a pet!).

      * If your agency lacks the budget for welcome bags, forward this page to your local community supporters to make bags on your behalf.

      * Kinship caregivers should get bags, too, although you might adjust the tone and message (and possibly the contents) of the delivery accordingly. You can still thank them for their sacrifices and include family activities like a game, craft project, or treats.

      **Walk a day in my shoes** is a creative art installation which depicts
      the real lives of care experienced young people. Care experienced young
      people taking part in the initiative were asked to design a shoe, which
      was then placed on a display board with a QR code next to it. By scanning
      the QR code the person can find out more about that person’s story and
      their authentic view of their care journey, as told by them. It captures
      how unique each person’s journey is to highlight why every child and young
      person should be treated as an individual and not simply a ‘looked-after’
      child. This installation has the potential to raise levels of awareness
      and change practice as well as give care experienced young people a
      platform to challenge the misconceptions that can often surround them.

      * If agency policy allows, look for community members who can volunteer to provide childcare. This can be a smart recruitment strategy to introduce more people to youth in care and the idea of fostering!

      * Depending on your agency's policies around childcare providers, you may need to perform background checks or other steps to assess childcare providers ahead of time.

      * Childcare should be for children in foster care as well as other children in the home. The care itself doesn't have to be fancy; putting on a movie can be enough.

      * Make sure that kinship caregivers are eligible for this childcare, too.

      Barnardo’s Brent **Care Journeys** has worked with care experienced young
      people, NHS and local authority staff to create a pre-birth assessment
      that focuses on the unique strengths of care experienced parents and
      removed the negative stigma which can impact on their experiences. This
      work captured the frustrations of young parents, who wanted to have their
      dreams and aims and ambitions for their families heard. The assessment
      tool has been adopted by Brent Council’s Social Care Team. It follows
      research by Care Journeys Future Pathways, which found that care
      experienced parents were poorly supported during pregnancy, often judged
      and stigmatised by professionals, they struggled to access support akin to
      that provided an extended family, and they also found it difficult to get
      mental health support. The report which followed the research presented a
      range of recommendations including the creation of family hubs; enabling
      care experienced parents to create their own ‘villages’ of support,
      extending corporate parenting to more public bodies such as the NHS and
      Police and greater access to mental health support.

      **Bristol Child Exploitation Collaboration** is a partnership with Bristol
      City Council to co-design specialist services for children who have been
      exploited or affected by community violence. In 2022, we conducted
      research with children who have been exploited and their families, along
      with the professionals who support them. This research, which forms the
      foundation for the co-design of a new exploitation service, focused on
      children’s lived experiences of services and how they think the services
      and systems can improve to keep them safe and support them into adulthood.
      98 children, families and professionals shared their experiences of
      navigating multiple systems and services focussing how this negatively
      affects them and, importantly, where practice was getting this right.


      The Institute of Public Care at Oxford Brookes University completed an insightful and supportive evaluation of our partnership. It highlights our work in gaining the voices of young people as ‘gold standard’ and including the voices of a wide range of stakeholders underpinning the value, power and credibility of the process. Our work identified 11 opportunities for change which are the basis for the new service.


      Based on the children’s experiences we created the ‘Here I am’ an immersive 360-degree film. It is aimed at commissioners and decision makers to ensure the child’s voices and experiences are central to decision making.

    how: >-
      * Try to make check-ins a human interaction, instead of relying on a paper
      or electronic survey. This takes more time but gets much richer
      information and much higher response rates. The worker conducting the
      check-in should capture what they learn on a structured form for internal
      analysis and reporting.

      * Make it as easy as possible for families to participate in check-ins. Work around their schedule, provide childcare, offer different meeeting options (in-person coffee or video chat or phone call).

      * Incorporate check-ins with existing meetings. If you have a worker going to do a home visit anyway, make it a practice for them to talk to the caregiver privately about how they're doing and whether they have questions or unmet needs. The worker should capture this information and there should be clear steps for follow-up.

      * Develop an agency practice for evaluating all check-in information at a regular cadence (such as quarterly or every six months) to look for high-level trends or themes that may indicate the need for new programs or supports, or changes. Sort information by area and by worker if you are in a larger system. You don't need a data scientist to spot problems.

      * Make sure to check in with families at least quarterly, and at key milestones, such as right after initial placements, and especially after removals / reunifications.

      * Provide caregivers an anonymous way to share more feedback.

      In collaboration with Penificent, a social enterprise that creates comic
      books and workshops that tackle social issues by taking inspiration from
      their lived experience growing up in London, we created **Exploited and
      Criminalised**. The story is based on Barnardo’s experiences of witnessing
      how young men who experience exploitation are regularly criminalised
      rather than identified as victims of exploitation. Therefore, they do not
      receive the support they need to recover. The idea was prompted by
      Barnardo’s 2019 Policy report of the same name and supports our calls for
      a statutory definition and consistent data collection on criminally
      exploited children. The comic is aimed at young people to open
      conversations and to amplify the issues of exploitation.
    how: >-
      * Formally capture when a family stops serving as a resource family. This
      might be when their license expires, when they submit a letter of
      termination, or when a kinship placement ends. If you do not have such
      clear milestones, come up with one, such as "has not taken a placement in
      over 12 months."

      * Capture the reason when caregivers close their license in your IT system. While all their answers won't necessarily be honest (it's hard to capture "they quit because they hated their worker" in a note), it's a start.

      * Differentiate between reasons that could have been avoided with agency action, and those that could not. Focus your efforts only on the former.

      **Care Friends** is an employee referral app that aims to support finding
      and retaining high-quality care staff in the social care sector. The app
      was launched in partnership with Skills for Care and is available on both
      web and mobile platforms. The app allows staff to refer their friends for
      job opportunities at the tap of a button, share job roles directly with
      their contacts or on social media, and recognize and reward staff. With an
      incentives scheme, referrers receive rewards as the person they have
      referred moves through the recruitment process

      into employment. The app also provides a leaderboard feature that makes collecting points fun and competitive. Each point converts to £1, which is paid through payroll. 


      **Care Friends** has been shown to support recruitment and retention of high-quality staff, with the app leading to five times more referrals than traditional means of recruitment. This method of recruitment also leads to an estimated 50% lower year one attrition rate than the sector average, due to greater staff suitability. It has also brought a new, diverse range of candidates into social care. The app also streamlines the administration associated with the

      recruitment process.


      **Care Friends** is also working on a project to look at how the app can be applied in children’s social care in Wales around boosting foster carer recruitment.

      The London Borough of Newham is investing in its social workers by
      providing a broad **career progression support programme**. The council
      offers excellent opportunities to develop skills, knowledge, and
      experience of working in a dynamic and progressive setting. The support
      includes membership of Making Research Count and CareKnowledge, which
      provides a wide range of evidence-informed practice and resources, access
      to a number of courses to apply for via the Apprenticeship route for all
      staff, and opportunities to work in a wide range of roles where one can
      develop knowledge and expertise alongside the provision of mandatory and
      non-mandatory training days and mentoring/shadowing arrangements. The
      council also offers Best Interest Assessor and Approved Mental Health
      Professional training opportunities for Social Workers, peer supervision
      sessions, and reflective practice. Newly Qualified Social Workers (NQSWs)
      receive consistent support in their first year of employment through the
      Assessed and Supported Year in Employment (ASYE) programme, which aims to
      ensure that NQSWs become confident, competent social work professionals.
      All new social workers also have access to a five-day training course in
      systemic practice. Newham’s overall work is underpinned by a Circles of
      Support practice framework, based on relational and anti-racist practice
      which focuses on providing a circle of support to both children and
      families, but also to social workers.


      The project aims to provide social workers with a structured programme of induction into professional social work, offering many benefits, including a personalized training and development plan, 1:1 support from trained and experienced ASYE assessors, reduced caseload, protected development time, training opportunities, internal moderation panel, clear appeals process, and career conversation at the end of the programme. The programme also provides opportunities to work alongside academics to deliver teaching sessions in their area of expertise, attend and participate in academic activities such as attending an accredited module relevant to social care, an admission day, participating in Skills Development Days and Practice Education Panels, and regular updates on various opportunities and recorded webinars.

      The Coram Innovation Incubator (CII) runs the **Coram Innovation Inset,**
      a five-session course offered to our members annually to support them to
      develop and implement an innovation pilot in their organisation. The Inset
      brings together a Design Thinking approach, social work theory and a focus
      on evaluation to help immerse participants in a problem, identify their
      end user, and think creatively about solutions. We then work together to
      support them to put this into practice and measure outcomes. The Inset
      course is offered as part of membership of the Incubator, with three staff
      from member organisations eligible to join at no extra cost each year.


      The Inset provides participants with a collaborative and supportive space to discuss challenges with like-minded people, confidence and tools to develop a pilot project, skills and expertise in evaluation, and two coaching sessions with an experienced, external coach, who is a tutor at the London Business School and Director of an independent innovation agency. CII member organisations benefit from staff time to explore practice challenges, upskilling colleagues, space for auditing and reflection, and a scalable project to address challenges.


      In 2023, we ran our second cohort of the Inset and worked with teams across our member organisations – many had a focus on staff wellbeing and retention, but we also worked with local authorities looking at improving supervision for foster carers, expanding edge of care services, and developing a new apprenticeship programme for young people interested in working in children’s social care. We also continued to work with participants from the first cohort to develop and scale their projects over the course of the year, and look forward to building on this success and running the Inset for the third time in 2024.


      You can find a case study from Aneesa and Margaret from the London Borough of Bromley on their experience of the Coram Innovation Inset here:


      When Aneesa and Margaret, who work for Bromley Council, joined Coram-i's Inset programme, they were facing a common problem amongst local authorities. Social workers in children’s services were leaving and becoming increasingly difficult to recruit.


      Aneesa, Head of MASH, Referral & Assessment and EDT for Bromley, was unsure of how the Inset programme would help, but six months later they finished with a pilot scheme idea that has proved very successful.


      Aneesa explains “We went in with an open mind but didn’t realise how beneficial the Inset programme would be. We had a problem that needed to be solved. Social worker turnover was huge, constantly doing interviews was exhausting. We thought the problem lay with our recruitment practices. The sessions helped us to think about the issue in different ways.


      “We really benefited from being in a room with other local authorities and the coaching we received helped us to think innovatively. We started looking at staff welfare and what we could do to make the lives of our social workers better. We know the job is very stressful and involves countless appointments and house visits, which are traditionally conducted between 9-5. This can be difficult for social workers and the people they are visiting who may have work and childcare commitments.


      Margaret, Practice Manager, explains how they introduced flexibility to the service.


      “We put out a survey asking our social workers if they would benefit from working their hours flexibly. We learnt a lot about what would make their lives better and the idea was well received. They were excited to have a better work-life balance and they felt better listened to and appreciated.


      “We piloted the scheme with one team and it has been really successful so we’re introducing it to another. Our social workers are more motivated and their wellbeing has really improved. Other teams are keen to get on board too! There is a real appetite for it.”


      The Bromley team are also working with CII partners at Microsoft to look at how simple technology solutions can also support their workforce in their work with children and families.


      The Inset programme has given Aneesa and Margaret a clear solution to a problem but they have benefited in other ways too as Aneesa explains.


      “Taking part in the programme gave us the time and space to step back and think outside the box. It has given us a new network of other local authorities who we can share best-practice with. We really enjoyed the one-to-one coaching too. We have even been introduced to some tech partners like Microsoft who are helping with other aspects of our work. I would really recommend the programme to other local authorities. You learn so much about your organisation, yourselves, and the joy of innovation.”

      The course is part of the Council’s ‘grow your own’ initiative, to boost the social work workforce via a number of routes. Once this 2-year course is completed, participants will be able to apply for a social work degree. The course seeks to equip learners with an understanding of the importance of early intervention and safeguarding work and key knowledge to help them manage risk across the spectrum of needs for children, young people, and families. It builds on previous work Torbay council have pioneered as part of their ‘grow your own initiative’, which includes a ‘Step Up’ progamme which enables graduates from professions such as teaching to fast track their social work qualification, as well as wider work the council have undertaken in collaboration with local universities.

    about: >+
      The Contingent is a project developed in partnership with Microsoft that
      aims to create a more diverse and inclusive workforce by leveraging
      location-based matching. The project is taking place in the United States,
      and its goal is to help companies find the right candidates for their job
      openings while also promoting diversity and inclusion. The **Every Child**
      initiative is a case study within the Contingent project that focuses on
      recruiting and hiring for child welfare agencies. The initiative aims to
      help these agencies find and hire the best candidates for their open
      positions, with a focus on diversity and inclusion.


      The **Every Child** initiative uses a location-based matching system to connect child welfare agencies with qualified candidates in their area. This system helps to ensure that candidates are familiar with the local community and can provide culturally sensitive care to the children they serve and in a range of ways. Part of the drive has been focused on supporting foster children. The initiative has already seen positive outcomes, with participating agencies reporting increased diversity in their


      workforce and improved outcomes for the children they serve. In 2022, the **Every Child** initiative engaged 2,341 community members to support their local child welfare system. By leveraging technology to promote diversity and inclusion, the **Every Child** initiative is helping to create a more equitable and just society for all.

      Following on from the London Pledge to address recruitment challenges, a
      £20m social worker recruitment initiative has been launched in London in
      the context of increasing costs in children’s social care. The **Framework
      for London in Permanent Children’s Social Work Recruitment (FLiP)** is a
      partnership between Yorkshire Purchasing Organisation (YPO), London
      Councils and the London Innovation & Improvement Alliance (LIIA) and seeks
      to improve compliant access to permanent children’s social workers for all
      London local authorities. The partnership will provide both “full” and
      “reduced” service offerings for London local authorities and define 16
      specialist children’s social care service providers both locally and
      regionally. The **FLiP** is a novel regional framework and guarantees
      uniformity in price structure, stable costs, a single point of contact for
      recruitment, and a standard of service through pre-agreed terms and
      conditions.


      The initiative is expected to increase councils’ access to permanent staff and help them save money on agency fees. The partnership will also help to address the shortage of social workers in London. The initiative was launched in August 2023 and is expected to have a positive impact on children’s social care in London.

      **Coram’s Activity Days for Fostering (ADFs)** provide a safe,fun
      environment for prospective foster carers and children to meet each other
      and explore whether they have a connection or ‘chemistry’. The days focus
      on finding loving, stable homes for children who need to remain looked
      after under fostering arrangements. The days are designed to make young
      people and foster carers active participants in their family finding
      process, enhancing the matching process and increasing the likelihood of a
      successful placement. The approach provides a unique opportunity to get to
      know each other authentically in a way that traditional matching processes
      may not. It is considered to be a particularly effective matching process
      for ‘harder to place’ children, for example those in a sibling group,
      children of a BAME background or with a disability. The events are
      arranged for local authorities, with the AdF service facilitating the
      event organisation, briefing sessions, a profiling workshop, management of
      referrals, consultation and feedback. The events build on Coram’s
      pioneering Adoption Activity Days (AADs), which have been running since
      2012, and enabled at least 1,400 children to find adoptive families,
      equating to a match for one in every four children attending an AAD. 


      Coram also runs Sibling Time activity days, providing a chance to develop sibling bonds for children in care. An [evaluation](https://www.coram.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Activity-Days-for-Fostering-evaluation-report-final-1.pdf) of ADFs was conducted by the Coram Impact and Evaluation team and funded by the Esmee Fairbairn Foundation and the Hadley Trust in March 2022. The findings were generally positive, with social workers and foster carers particularly enthusiastic about the approach. Many of the children who attended belong to groups that we would typically consider ‘hard to place’ and almost a third of the expressions of interest led to provisional matches.

    about: >
      In response to a growing number of newborn babies becoming subject to care
      proceedings post-birth, the London Borough of Redbridge created the **Baby
      and Me** service in August 2021. This early-intervention service assesses
      and provides support to families who are about to have their first child,
      or who have had children removed from their care in past, in an attempt to
      ensure newborn babies have the best start in life and can live safely at
      home with their families. Traditionally, assessments and support to
      pregnant women had not been delivered until later on in the pregnancy at
      around 24 weeks gestation. However, the **Baby and Me** team works with
      women from a much earlier stage at around 12 weeks’ gestation in order to
      try and mitigate escalation to a point of crisis, which often emerges
      later in pregnancy for vulnerable women. In order to be able to offer
      comprehensive, multi-agency support to families, the service is also
      developing its strategic pathways with midwifery, health visiting,
      perinatal and other adult services. By engaging early and ensuring
      families are supported to work through any challenges they face, the hope
      is that fewer babies in Redbridge will enter the care system.

    about: "The **Building My Future programme**


      **(BMF)** is an early intervention model, originally funded by the
      DfE’s children’s social care innovation unit, in the London Borough of
      Ealing. Co-produced with carers and young people, the programme provides
      intensive, holistic, tailored support to young people aged 10-25 with
      complex additional needs, who are at risk of educational or social
      exclusion. By intervening early with this group, the intention was to
      facilitate better educational, wellbeing and participation outcomes, and
      reduce the need for special school provision and costs to the council. It
      came in the context of key council pressures including a high number of
      exclusions among SEN students. The model has a multi-disciplinary element,
      involving professionals from health, social care, education and youth
      work, who work together to explore the specific challenges each young
      person may have which may be a barrier to them reaching their academic
      potential. Young people are supported over a 6-month period in multiple
      ways - for example, where there are mental health needs identified, the
      psychology team can offer CBT interventions, and there is also a focus on
      developing key life and social skills. The project worked with over 150
      children and young people between 2018 and 2021.


      The programme was evaluated in 2020. The multi-disciplinary,
      coordinated approach was praised, with suggestions that the programme
      helped to improve young people’s personal wellbeing, participation in
      mainstream education and preparedness for adult life. It also helped
      parents and carers to improve their relationships with their child and
      school/college, as well as preparing schools and colleges to better
      support children with additional needs. The quantitative data showed less
      obvious improvements, but there was a suggestion that it would contribute
      to long-term cost avoidance. The evaluation highlighted some key
      challenges to the programme’s sustainability, related to funding, demand,
      workforce and complexity of need. The programme is no longer operating but
      with the model winning a CYPN award, there are clearly key lessons to be
      taken on the value of adopting a multi agency approach to improving key
      outcomes for this cohort of young people.

      The **Brighton Streets** project offers early relationship based
      interventions to teenagers in an attempt to prevent them from getting
      involved in youth violence. Funded by the Brighton & Hove Violence
      Reduction Partnership, this programme operates across the city and is run
      by Trust for Developing Communities, alongside community development
      charities, the Hangleton and Knoll Project and the Tarner Community
      Project. **Brighton Streets** is built around the idea that youth work
      should be detached and streetbased, and proactively brought to young
      people where they are, in keeping with criminological theory. It focuses
      on developing trusted relationships and taking a personcentred approach to
      create a safe space for young people and empower them as part of the
      community. Taking a preventative approach, detached youth workers are
      trained to support people across a number of issues related to mental
      health, sexual health, knife crime and substance misuse or provide
      referrals to other specialists, as well as being able to divert young
      people towards other positive projects.


      **Brighton Streets** was evaluated by the Centre for Education and Youth in 2021, who emphasised the advantage and value to young people of being able to access help and support that comes to them, rather than requiring them to seek out specific services. The research suggested that the **Brighton Streets** approach to youth work helped young people to feel safe and to de-escalate potentially unsafe situations, as well as providing them

      with someone to talk to. The evaluation also suggested that detached youth work did support a decline in crime and violence - this was due partly to the physical presence of youth workers on the street, but also because young people gained a greater understanding of the consequences of crime. The research did suggest improvements could be made in terms of youth workers advertising their location and facilitating links with other specific services, but this model of youth work appears to engage young people and help steer them away from criminality. The initiative won the 2021 CYPN Partnership Award.

    about: >
      Commended by Ofsted in 2018, Leeds City Council uses the **Cluster
      Collaborative** model to offer early help to local families. In Leeds,
      there are 23 ‘clusters’ which are made up of schools and key partners in
      small localities. Clusters have combined funding from schools, with
      additional funding from health services and the local authority, to
      provide early help services for children aged 4 to 16 who go to one of the
      schools within the Cluster and have challenges within the remit of early
      help. Such challenges may be mental health (child or familial), housing
      related, to do with parental conflict, domestic abuse or substance
      misuse. 


      Each individual, multi-agency model is specific to the local needs of the Cluster and combines universal,

      targeted and specialist services across schools, health, police, social work, the third sector and housing. The rationale is to identify and provide appropriate support for families early on so that children can do better at school and foster positive relationships with peers and trusted adults, and parents can develop self-efficacy. In turn, it also looks to mitigate statutory involvement and children entering the care system, also leading to cost savings for the council. Children can be referred by their schools, Children’s Services or by local health professionals through a Single Point of Access, or families can self-refer. As part of the intervention, which follows the relationship-based Leeds Practice Principles, each family works on a family plan of goals decided on with a practitioner. Families have a lead worker, who regularly reviews goals in meetings but is also a contact for the family outside weekly meetings. Family plans are also discussed as part of group supervision. The way the support is delivered varies with different therapeutic models and there are six Restorative Early Support Teams in Leeds which can provide more intensive, specialist

      support and three Early Help Hubs offering short-term intervention. The Cluster provides support for a

      maximum of six months, with weekly meetings, but there are also specific therapy offers for parents and children within this. 


      A pilot looking at the effectiveness of this model is being funded by the WWC Spark Grant scheme and is due to report imminently.

      social connections and networks and offering practical help too. The model

      is based on the fundamental principles of choice, relationships and strength, with families working

      together on a bespoke set of goals of the family’s choice. Children are empowered to play a central role in helping positive changes materialise for the family. In addition, family and children’s coaches on hand to help facilitate the goals. The hope is that this type of intervention can reduce escalation to crisis and negate the need for referral to statutory services. This intervention was shown to be beneficial to families in Australia and the pilot currently taking place in Stoke.

      The NSPCC’s **Infant and Family Team** was inspired by the New Orleans
      Intervention Model. This multidisciplinary specialist team aims to support
      reunification by working with fostered infants and young children aged
      between 0-5 years, who are in care due to abuse or neglect, and their
      birth and foster families. The programme runs over 9-15 months and works
      to assess the child and parent’s health and wellbeing, and deliver
      tailored support to build the child-parent relationship, promote infant
      mental health and deal with key issues. The Infant and Family Team is able
      to contribute to decisions about a child’s care plan via reports to social
      work and legal teams. In cases where the parent has changed positively
      after the treatment programme and demonstrated a capacity to care for the
      child, children are able to return to their birth families. This is an
      earlyintervention programme, which seeks to negate detrimental impacts on
      infant development and mental health. An initial case audit looking at the
      impact of the Glasgow Infant and Family Team indicated that those
      participating endorsed the focus on infant mental health and felt the
      assessment process was comprehensive and thorough. It was said that the
      evidence produced by the team was also helpful to decisionmaking, although
      there was a debate about the timescale of the programme and the potential
      for this to lead to delays for children. The NSPCC is currently working in
      partnership with a number of local authorities and other organisations on
      a randomised controlled trial to look at the impact of Infant and Family
      Teams and the findings are expected in 2023.

      Founded in 2018 with Stockport Council, **New Beginnings** works with
      families involved in the child protection system. The programme recognises
      the past trauma many of these parents have experienced, which can
      contribute to mental health, alcohol and drug difficulties. It is based on
      a holistic approach to working with parents, which was evident in family
      centres in Flanders, Belgium.

       A 24-week programme, **New Beginnings** supports parents to understand their past and identity and develop their strength, knowledge, skills and ability to improve their parenting via weekly group sessions and support other parents. The sessions are delivere  by therapeutic social work practitioners and act as a safe space for parents to share challenges together. **New Beginnings** also run 1:1 key work sessions with parents, and key workers are able to support parents through child protection meetings and help them navigate the complex process. The strength-based Video Interaction Guidance approach helps parents to better connect with their children. In addition, parents who have previously worked through the **New Beginnings** programme are able to become peer mentors to other parents, harnessing the value of support from those with lived experience.

      An initial evaluation of **New Beginnings’** pilot cohort highlighted a meaningful, positive change in parents’ involvement with children’s social care, as well as a better understanding of safety and risk and how to create a safe home environment. It was noted that risk to children involved in the pilot were related to emotional harm, educational attainment, neglect and protection from domestic abuse. The evaluation also emphasised the importance of the relationship

      developed between **New Beginnings** staff and parents, which were sensitive and trusting. Stockport Council indicated that the programme could lead to cost savings of around £219,000. The peer mentoring element of the project was also analysed, with reports from peer mentors that participating in this project had been ‘life changing’ for them and mentees reflected on the availability and value of their peer mentors positively, helping them to better engage with social work teams. The programme was highlighted in the Care Review as a positive approach to better parental engagement in the child protection system.

    about: >
      Funded by the National Lottery Community A Better Start programme, **Small
      Steps, Big Changes** is an activity programme aimed at children aged 4 and
      under in Nottingham. The programme helps children to develop their speech,
      language and communication skills and confidence, understand their
      emotions and behaviour and promotes a healthy lifestyle. Activities
      offered as part of the programme range from sensory play sessions to
      singing, speech and language and cooking sessions to wellbeing and
      employability sessions for parents. As well as building skills, such
      sessions have been an important step in helping young children who spent
      much of their life in lockdown to develop crucial social skills and enable
      their parents to meet and interact with other parents and families. In
      addition, support is given to new parents in their homes via Family
      Mentors as part of the free Small Steps At Home programme. An interim
      report on the programme suggested that the Small Steps at Home programme
      helped to narrow the gap in terms of development of skills measured via
      the Ages and Stages questionnaire between children in more deprived areas
      receiving the intervention and those in more affluent areas. It also
      suggested an initiative to provide age-appropriate books to children as
      part of the programme may help parents to interact with their children
      whilst reading and encourage children to ask their parents to read with
      them and look at books, although they were not necessarily more likely to
      read with their child. Engaging both parents and young children at a
      crucial time of their development, programmes such as this are important
      to early years development and helping to ease the transition into a
      school environment.

      What Works for Children’s Social Care recently released its evaluation of
      Our Skills, an intervention offered to parents of Reception and Year 1
      children who have had a social worker, to help their children to read and
      learn at home. This course is delivered over 20 sessions, 10 of which are
      for parents and carers only and 10 where children take part. Specialist
      tutors support children and families with phonics, reading strategies,
      story-telling, and learning through play. Across the trial period, 100
      parents and 103 children from 33 schools across the country took part,
      with Covid a barrier to recruitment of schools, parents and carers. Covid
      also meant the course was delivered online, having originally been
      conceived as a face-to-face programme. The evaluation highlighted these
      challenges, but among those parents and carers who did attend the majority
      of the sessions, and the schools involved, feedback was positive. Where
      the programme was delivered as intended, it demonstrated evidence of
      promise, boosting confidence of parents and carers and understanding of
      how phonics is taught as well as impacting enjoyment of reading with
      children and among children. There was a suggestion that these changes
      could impact on behaviour and reading attainment. It recommended a review
      of the delivery model to improve the offer.

      In Cambridgeshire, Ormiston Families’ **Small Steps Together** team
      supports new and expectant mothers presenting with low to  moderate mental
      health needs  during their pregnancy and up until their children are 2.
      The specialist team is made up both of staff and  volunteers, including
      specialist perinatal mental health workers and those with lived
      experience. The team offers a range of interventions, also involving
      partners and other family members. These interventions include 1:1
      counselling, support to access community services, fitness and wellbeing
      activities and innovative use of Video Interactive Guidance (VIG), which
      focuses on supporting parents to develop their own strengths and foster
      nurturing relationships with their children. Since the service launched in
      September 2017, the team has worked with 315 families in Cambridgeshire,
      as well as undertaking a pilot project in West Norfolk. The team aims to
      work with 165 families each year, including those families who stay
      engaged over a number of years. 


      The impact on families has been positive: 98% of parents have said that the programme supported increased attachment to their children, with 96% saying the support helped to improve their mental health. 100% of families contacted after three months continue to access community wellbeing support and activities, 

      and feel their children experience improved wellbeing and reach development milestones earlier. The service has also been widely commended externally and won the Early Years Award at the CYPN Awards in 2021.

      In a bid to provide better, earlier support to children in Stockport,
      Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council offers the **Team Around the School
      (TAS)** model. Originally developed in 2016, the model follows restorative
      practice principles and embeds partnership working between the key
      agencies and people in a child’s life, including parents/carers, schools,
      local authorities and other agencies. It acknowledges the unique
      day-to-day insight into children afforded to school staff and includes the
      school safeguarding team, social workers, school nurses and a school age
      plus worker. By convening this multi-agency team regularly and providing a
      broader picture of a family’s circumstances, the model facilitates timely
      information sharing to the relevant professionals to ensure any issues can
      be raised and dealt with at an early stage for a child before the
      situation escalates. It also supports better engagement with families by
      involving them in a child’s care plan and social care by the daily support
      and advice offered by the social worker. This reduces demand on MASH
      services by mitigating the need for social care referrals and dealing with
      issues locally; in one year, Stockport saw 650 less contacts to their MASH
      team from schools.

      Funded by the National Lottery Community Fund, Adoption UK’s **TESSA-UK**
      service seeks to promote wellbeing and positive relationships among
      adoptive families to enable children and families to thrive. This approach
      looks to help adoptive parents to understand and support a child with
      early childhood trauma and in turn improve their longer-term development
      and stability. It is offered as an early intervention tool with families
      within the first three years of adoption, where early childhood trauma has
      been identified as having the potential to cause issues. Through
      **TESSA**, adopters are paired with a Parent Partner, offering peer
      support on specific issues and goals. They are also given access to a
      clinical psychologist, a preventative approach which addresses the issue
      where often adoptive families are not able to access clinical support
      until crisis necessitates it. In addition, there is a reflective parenting
      group, which runs fortnightly for six sessions and is facilitated by an
      adopter and a clinical professional.


      A pilot evaluation of the impact was conducted by the University of Strathclyde in anticipation of a larger evaluation that will run between 2021 and 2023. Among the pilot cohort, 85% of adopters said that the clinical consultation offered had improved their understanding of and their ability to articulate the needs of their child, with the production of a clinical consultation report which detailed the child’s strengths and needs and could be shared with professionals - 99% said the clinical consultation report was helpful. 85% of adopters also agreed that having a Parent Partner had been beneficial. According to SDQ measures, children’s total difficulty scores also decreased. Other reported benefits of engaging with **TESSA** were an improved confidence in dealing with challenges, and anticipating stressful triggers, as well as feeling better able to cope and less isolated. The findings indicate that a proactive approach to post-adoption support, which encompasses peer support, is important to helping adopters meet the needs of their children.

      In Manchester, the council are piloting the **Thriving Babies: Confident
      Parents** programme, which looks to provide early support to potentially
      vulnerable parents before and after their babies are born. Those eligible
      for support include parents with complex vulnerabilities, including
      learning disability, those with mental health or substance misuse issues,
      those who have been subject to domestic abuse, those who have had a child
      removed or have experienced the care system. The intervention, which takes
      place in the family home and in children’s centres, is being piloted with
      60 families over a 12 month period, with targeted outreach to BAME
      families. It focuses on proactively supporting parents to develop their
      skills, strengths, resilience and wellbeing, as well as helping them to
      understand the needs of babies and children. The involvement with the
      family is coordinated by a key worker assigned to each family, and the
      programme aims to ensure support is holistic, joined up and caters to the
      needs of the families at that time. There is engagement with both the
      voluntary sector and adult services, and families are provided with a
      Think Family Co-Ordinator.


      The pilot is looking at whether this process enables services to provide better, more culturally attuned and coordinated support to families and the knock on effect this has on outcomes for children e.g. better parenting, fewer risk factors, greater permanency for infants. The Institute of Public Care at Oxford Brookes University will be producing an evaluation report later in 2022. Acknowledging the fundamental importance of the early years of a child’s life to their life chances, this multi-agency approach is showing promise in facilitating a reduction in escalation to statutory services, better early permanence decision making and overall ensuring parents can be better support to navigate a crucial time in their lives and the lives of their children.

      Affinity 2020 CIC and Unravel piloted the **Tiny Tots College Programme**.
      This programme combines theoretical and practical elements and is
      delivered to care-experienced young parents aged 25 and under across two
      interventions: Tiny Tots – Care Informed Parenting (pre-birth for
      expectant parents) and Tiny Tots – Toddlers (post-birth for children aged
      0-2). The former element was created by Unravel, a specialist support
      company, with the involvement of psychology professionals. The latter was
      developed by Affinity 2020 CIC, a social enterprise which is focused on
      the care experience. The premise of the programme is to use play and
      communication to help build skills, understanding, knowledge and
      confidence around child development among careexperienced parents. The aim
      is to support the development of positive relationships and enable
      positive emotional attachment between the parent and child. It is
      delivered via weekly sessions over 8 weeks and includes a peer support and
      staff support offer.


      What Works for Children’s Social Care evaluated a pilot programme with nine families which took place virtually in 2021. The findings suggested that both staff and parents benefited from theinterventions, with it helping to improve knowledge and confidence around parenting, pregnancy and childbirth as staff and parents developed positive, non-judgemental relationships. It highlighted the importance of parents having a safe space to air key issues and seek advice outside of statutory services. Another positive element emphasised was the peer support offer. It did acknowledge the small sample size, the reduced number of referrals to the programme and the short-term impact measure which limits the ability to attribute a causal impact. Nonetheless, there were clearly positive gains for families via this approach.

      Hartlepool Borough Council has piloted a **Transition Support** programme
      for children transitioning from primary to secondary schools who are on a
      Child in Need or Child Protection Plan. Recognising the often disruptive
      nature of transition to secondary school, especially for children with a
      social worker, and the challenges of education attainment among this
      cohort, the pilot programme focuses on children in Years 5 and 6 and
      involves a number of elements. These include creating Transition Leads for
      each school, as well as facilitating whole-school and targeted training
      for both school staff and social worker. The Transitioning Planning
      Profile Tool (TPPT) was also developed as an administrative tool for
      schools as part of this project. Up to three PersonCentred Planning (PCP)
      meetings are also offered to each child, with parents/carers, pupils,
      social workers and primary and secondary school staff attending. In
      addition, the children receive interventions, including being enrolled on
      a resilience programme and having one-to-one therapeutic support. Each
      child also has a Transition Passport detailing their situation. The
      programme looks to provide schools with a fuller insight into a child’s
      needs to inform a personalised support plan to help them manage the
      transition to secondary school and in turn positively contribute to their
      educational attainment. It should be noted that in Hartlepool there is a
      broader transition support programme for year 6 pupils, but not all
      elements of the pilot are included. The National Centre for Social
      Research evaluated the pilot and the impact on 55 year 6 pupils from 21
      schools. The evaluation indicated that the development of the TPPT had
      enhanced information sharing between schools to some extent, with PCP
      meetings helpful in bringing people together. There is some sense from
      qualitative findings that these children settled well in secondary school,
      with slight improvements in attainment and attendance. However, there were
      also some issues noted including attendance, sustainability and ability to
      share information via PCP meetings.


      There were also some delivery challenges, partly attributable to Covid. There are suggestions that the model needs to be refined before it is more widely rolled out to improve its impact and ensure it works better for schools and children, acknowledging the iterative process of innovation.

      All CCGs are expected to take part, and it will be offered to all schools.


      The project began in 2019 and was expected to run for four years. Due to Covid sessions were run online to bring together health and education colleagues. The programme is structured around two initial workshops to explore joint working, understanding the mental health conditions that are most commonly seen, reflect on how these issues are managed, and how to measure wellbeing.


      There have been two initial pilot evaluations conducted by an independent evaluation team. These found better communication between services, increased knowledge of mental health conditions and treatment pathways, and has acted as a catalyst for wider change with a better understanding of evidence-based practice.


      The offer was adapted and pivoted to become a free, bespoke facilitation for local strategic leaders, to be delivered completely online from May 2021, until the project ended in March 2022.
