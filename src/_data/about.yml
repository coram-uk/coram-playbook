about: >
  The **Coram Innovation Playbook** is Coram's dedicated platform to showcase
  the range of new projects, initiatives and innovations being trialed to
  improve the lives of children, young people and their families.


  This dynamic, knowledge-sharing hub seeks to enable children's services providers to remain at the forefront of innovation in the sector, share what they are doing and take inspiration into their own work.

  ## Coram Innovation Incubator


  The **Coram Innovation Incubator (CII)** is a specialist vehicle for children’s services providers to generate, test and scale innovative solutions to shared challenges facing the children’s social care sector. 


  We work alongside a range of innovative local authorities, charities and private sector pioneers to unlock the innovations that can deliver transformative change for children, young people, families and those working in the sector. We are proud to be supported by Microsoft, EY and PA Consulting in this endeavour.


  The CII's broad programme involves a number of enriching knowledge sharing events, webinars and learning sets, forums to discuss practice improvements, as well as dedicated capacity to support the development of innovation projects in practice.
